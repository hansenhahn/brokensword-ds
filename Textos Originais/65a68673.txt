[HEADER 00003A98]
I can't find my way to the ward.

[HEADER 00003AA2]
You need to talk to the receptionist on the front desk - who could you pretend to be?

[HEADER 00003AAC]
Show her Moerlin's card, and ask about Nurse Grendal.

[HEADER 00003AB6]
Nurse Grendel won't let me on the ward.

[HEADER 00003AC0]
You'll need a disguise.

[HEADER 00003ACA]
There's a cupboard next to the janitor but he won't let you go in. So try distracting him.

[HEADER 00003AD4]
Unplug Mr Shiny and then nip into the cupboard when the janitor's gone.

[HEADER 00003ADE]
I'm not a doctor! How do I get through these wards?

[HEADER 00003AE8]
Head back to the hospital entrance.

[HEADER 00003AF2]
Speak to the older doctor, and agree to look after his nephew Benoir.

[HEADER 00003AFC]
I can't operate this blood pressure thing, and the patient won't let me past.

[HEADER 00003B06]
You need a helping hand from your new friend.

[HEADER 00003B10]
Give the blood pressure gauge to Benoir, and ask him to treat the patient.

[HEADER 00003B1A]
Now you can make your way to the private ward on the right.

[HEADER 00200001]
The woman managed to look over worked and hassled though she didn't appear to be doing anything...

[HEADER 00220089]
Hi! I'm Doctor Stobbart.

[HEADER 00200005]
Yes, Sir?

[HEADER 0020003A]
Oh, it doesn't matter...

[HEADER 00200004]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 00200006]
Is this the Hagenmeyer clinic?

[HEADER 00200007]
That's correct.

[HEADER 00200008]
I thought I was in a garden centre...

[HEADER 00200009]
Oh, the plants! They were my idea.

[HEADER 0020000A]
A little greenery to evoke the spirit of nature!

[HEADER 0020000B]
How may I help you?

[HEADER 00200017]
So, do I get to see Marquet before the funeral?

[HEADER 00200018]
That attitude will get you nowhere!

[HEADER 00200019]
My instructions were quite clear: no-one gets to see Marquet.

[HEADER 0020001A]
So, unless you can prove you're a relative or a close acquaintance, you're wasting your time here.

[HEADER 0020000C]
I'm here to see Jacques Marquet.

[HEADER 0020000D]
Oh, yes.

[HEADER 0020000E]
Are you related to our client, Sir?

[HEADER 00200011]
Yeah - I'm his, uh... long-lost brother.

[HEADER 00200012]
A brother half his age, with a different name and an American accent?

[HEADER 00200013]
Yeah. People always say that. I blame mom.

[HEADER 00200014]
We were separated at an early age after a mix-up in the nursery at the Oakland Shopping Mall.

[HEADER 00200015]
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life!

[HEADER 00200016]
I guess not.

[HEADER 0020000F]
No. I'm conducting a private investigation.

[HEADER 00200010]
Then I can't help you.

[HEADER 0020006D]
Look at this ID pass...

[HEADER 0020006E]
So you're Moerlin?

[HEADER 0020006F]
Marquet has been asking for you!

[HEADER 00200070]
For me?

[HEADER 00200071]
Yes! He was shouting your name when they brought him in here!

[HEADER 00200072]
Now let me see...

[HEADER 00200073]
He was on ward B-Twelve, as I recall...

[HEADER 00200074]
Oh! He's been transferred to...

[HEADER 00200075]
Oh dear. He's on ward J-Two.

[HEADER 00200076]
That's...

[HEADER 00200077]
Nurse Grendel's ward!

[HEADER 00200078]
Yes, dear - you showed me already.

[HEADER 0020001F]
Has Marquet been visited by a man in a clown costume?

[HEADER 00200020]
Oh, no.

[HEADER 00200021]
You haven't seen a man in disguise?

[HEADER 00200022]
Well, there's Theodore the Bear. He comes every Thursday, to entertain the children.

[HEADER 00200023]
Personally, I think he scares them half to death in that crummy old bear suit.

[HEADER 00200024]
If I was stuck on my back with tubes in every orifice, he's the last person I'd want to see.

[HEADER 0020001B]
Has Marquet had a visit from a pair of gangsters?

[HEADER 0020001C]
I should hope not! Can you describe them?

[HEADER 0020001D]
A thin guy who looks like a weasel, and his friend, the gorilla.

[HEADER 0020001E]
It sounds as if they escaped from a zoo!

[HEADER 00200025]
What's so bad about nurse Grendel?

[HEADER 00200026]
She runs that ward like a South American prison!

[HEADER 00200027]
Keeping a well disciplined ward isn't a crime, is it?

[HEADER 00200028]
Well disciplined?

[HEADER 00200029]
In the discipline and punishment stakes she'd whip the butt off the Marquis de Sade!

[HEADER 0020002A]
Everything, I mean everything, is done to a strict routine.

[HEADER 0020002B]
Six o'clock: alarm call.

[HEADER 0020002C]
Six-ten: bowel movements, and woe betide anyone who doesn't have a result!

[HEADER 0020002D]
Those patients of hers are like Pavlova's dogs!

[HEADER 0020002E]
She sounds like a real nightmare...

[HEADER 0020002F]
And then some!

[HEADER 00200030]
If nurse Grendel is that bad, how come the authorities tolerate her?

[HEADER 00200031]
She's like part of the furniture.

[HEADER 00200034]
I was beginning to get the picture. This woman was jealous, with a big green capital `J'.

[HEADER 00200035]
How do I find nurse Grendel's ward?

[HEADER 00200036]
Down the corridor on the left, turn right at the Senior Consultants' washroom...

[HEADER 00200037]
...and right again at the executive coffee lounge.

[HEADER 00200038]
Bear left past the Administrators' sauna...

[HEADER 00200039]
...and turn left at the end. That's J-Two - and good luck!

[HEADER 0020006B]
Have you seen this man here at the clinic?

[HEADER 0020006C]
No, Sir, and I never forget a face.

[HEADER 0020003D]
Does this ball mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0020003E]
No, dear.

[HEADER 0020003F]
What does this false nose remind you of?

[HEADER 00200040]
Ah! It's a clown's nose!

[HEADER 00200043]
What does this gem suggest to you?

[HEADER 00200044]
I advise you not to flash that around.

[HEADER 00200046]
What does this tool suggest to you?

[HEADER 00200047]
Is it a crack detector?

[HEADER 00200048]
Huh?

[HEADER 00200049]
Polar explorers use them to poke about in the snow...

[HEADER 0020004A]
Oh, no.

[HEADER 00200042]
Why don't you give me a break and go and play with someone else?

[HEADER 0020004B]
Have you heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 0020004C]
No. It sounds romantic, doesn't it?

[HEADER 0020004F]
Is this plaster any use to you?

[HEADER 00200050]
I'm allergic to plaster.

[HEADER 00200054]
I'd like to shake you by the hand...

[HEADER 00200055]
Don't be fresh, young man.

[HEADER 0020005B]
Can you think of any use for this greasy tissue?

[HEADER 0020005C]
I guess you could use it to baste a roast turkey...

[HEADER 0020005D]
I've got a toilet chain from a bar in Syria...

[HEADER 00200061]
You sad man.

[HEADER 00200062]
Do you know anything about this tripod?

[HEADER 00200064]
It looks like the one which was stolen from the Crune!

[HEADER 00200065]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 00200066]
I know what that is.

[HEADER 00200067]
It's a contact lens for a myopic cow.

[HEADER 00200068]
Nurse Grendel will be so pleased you've found it.

[HEADER 00200069]
Did I show you this lens?

[HEADER 0020006A]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 00200051]
I'd like to return this device...

[HEADER 00200052]
Not to me you don't.

[HEADER 00200053]
I don't touch medical equipment, especially if you've used it on sick people.

[HEADER 0020003B]
Thanks for your help, ma'am

[HEADER 0020003C]
You're welcome!

[HEADER 00210000]
As I turned the corner I saw the source of the hellish noise which echoed through the corridors.

[HEADER 00210001]
It was an industrial polishing machine with an odd-looking guy in tow...

[HEADER 00200002]
The guy seemed to be practising his air of authority. Today he was working on his withering stare.

[HEADER 0020007D]
Excuse me, Sir...

[HEADER 0020007E]
Hi! My name's George Stobbart!

[HEADER 00200080]
Really.

[HEADER 00200081]
If you wish to make an appointment, see the receptionist.

[HEADER 0020007F]
Ah-ha! Just the man...!

[HEADER 00200082]
You must be the new boy.

[HEADER 00200083]
Uh... yeah, I must be.

[HEADER 00200084]
Well, stop wandering about and make yourself useful...

[HEADER 00200085]
Bunny! Come here, boy.

[HEADER 00200086]
This is Benoir, my nephew.

[HEADER 00200087]
Can I trust you to look after him?

[HEADER 0020008C]
Do your own baby-sitting, gramps.

[HEADER 0020008D]
Who do you think you are, anyhow?

[HEADER 0020008E]
I am Felix Hagenmeyer.

[HEADER 0020008F]
And may I say what an honour it is to meet you in person, Sir.

[HEADER 00200090]
You're on my Medical Wall of Fame, right up there with Pasteur and Leary!

[HEADER 00200091]
I look on it as a privilege, no - an honour, to look after your nephew, Sir.

[HEADER 00200092]
He's fresh out of medical school.

[HEADER 00200093]
It will open his eyes to see a real doctor on the job...

[HEADER 00200094]
I'll bet!

[HEADER 00200095]
Show him around. Let him see some real suffering!

[HEADER 00200096]
I'm looking for a guy named Jacques Marquet.

[HEADER 00200097]
In which department does he work?

[HEADER 00200098]
He doesn't. He's a patient.

[HEADER 00200099]
I see.

[HEADER 0020009A]
You do realize there are strict policies regarding visiting hours, don't you?

[HEADER 0020009B]
Lost him, have you? Don't worry about it.

[HEADER 0020009C]
He'll turn up. Have you tried physio?

[HEADER 0020009D]
Whenever I lose a patient that's the first place I check out.

[HEADER 0020009E]
This is important. I have to talk to Marquet urgently.

[HEADER 0020009F]
We make no exceptions to the rules.

[HEADER 002000A0]
It's a matter of life and death!

[HEADER 002000A1]
The well-oiled running of this hospital is a matter of life and death!

[HEADER 002000A2]
That's why we have rules.

[HEADER 002000A3]
I think I ought to warn you that Marquet is not what he seems...

[HEADER 002000A4]
Explain yourself.

[HEADER 002000A5]
He's in league with a bunch of guys who want to take over the world.

[HEADER 002000A6]
Nonsense!

[HEADER 002000A9]
Besides, Marquet's employers have paid, in advance, for one of our most exclusive private rooms.

[HEADER 002000AA]
Could you tell me who Marquet's employers are?

[HEADER 002000AB]
Certainly not!

[HEADER 002000B0]
Do you recognize this red nose, Sir?

[HEADER 002000B1]
No, I do not.

[HEADER 002000B2]
This is a hospital, not a circus ring.

[HEADER 002000B3]
We minister to the sick in body, not the sick in mind.

[HEADER 002000C0]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 002000C1]
No, Sir, I do not.

[HEADER 002000AE]
Would you like this ball?

[HEADER 002000AF]
Certainly not! The playing of ball games on hospital properties is prohibited.

[HEADER 002000B4]
Does this old cup mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002000B5]
What the devil is it?

[HEADER 002000B6]
It's the communion chalice of the de Vasconcellos.

[HEADER 002000B7]
There are rules about the use of devotional equipment on hospital property...

[HEADER 002000BE]
Did I show you this chalice?

[HEADER 002000BF]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 002000C5]
Look at this, doc. It's a genuine Medieval type gemstone.

[HEADER 002000C6]
Yes, so I see.

[HEADER 002000C7]
Remarkable.

[HEADER 002000C8]
I have to take this gem to Marquet.

[HEADER 002000C9]
He might be able to explain its significance.

[HEADER 002000CA]
My dear chap, Marquet has other things on his mind right now.

[HEADER 002000CB]
Like what?

[HEADER 002000CC]
His catheter, for one.

[HEADER 002000D0]
Does the name Thomas Moerlin mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002000D1]
No, it does not.

[HEADER 002000D2]
Does this tool mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002000D3]
Sacre bleu! That's exactly what I needed in my last operation!

[HEADER 002000D4]
It is?

[HEADER 002000D5]
I had to improvise with a knitting needle and a couple of corks.

[HEADER 002000D6]
If only you'd been on hand at the time...

[HEADER 002000D7]
My patient would have given his right arm for it!

[HEADER 002000D8]
Yes. I really must get one like it myself...

[HEADER 002000D9]
Have you ever heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 002000DA]
No, Sir, I have not.

[HEADER 002000DB]
Does this white powder mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002000DC]
No, Sir. I do not pretend to know the pharmacist's job.

[HEADER 002000DD]
Look what Nurse Grendel gave me, Sir.

[HEADER 002000DE]
Ah, yes. Very good. I'm glad to see you're carrying it with you.

[HEADER 002000E1]
May I have the honour of shaking you by the hand?

[HEADER 002000E2]
You may not. I don't encourage physical contact between my staff.

[HEADER 002000E3]
What do you make of this tissue, Sir?

[HEADER 002000E6]
If I were you I'd have this sample analyzed.

[HEADER 002000E9]
Is this chain any use to you?

[HEADER 002000EA]
No.

[HEADER 002000EB]
Does this tripod mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002000EC]
No, it does not.

[HEADER 002000AD]
Thanks for your help.

[HEADER 00200079]
Stop! Come here!

[HEADER 0020007A]
What's the problem, gramps?

[HEADER 0020007B]
Where do you think you're sloping off to?

[HEADER 0020007C]
Get back to work immediatement!

[HEADER 001F0002]
There was no sign of the crew of the ambulance...

[HEADER 001F0003]
I felt a little guilty as I tried the door - like I was about to rob a grave.

[HEADER 001F0004]
I gripped the handle with an involuntary tremble in my hand and pulled...

[HEADER 001F0005]
The door was locked.

[HEADER 00210006]
The connector in the socket supplied electricity to the polishing machine.

[HEADER 00210007]
As I tugged the plug out of the socket the polishing machine coughed, spluttered and died.

[HEADER 002100A7]
Take that, you stubborn tin can!

[HEADER 002100A8]
Not again! This is not a good day!

[HEADER 002100A9]
Mr. Shiny! What's wrong, pal?

[HEADER 00210002]
The door didn't have a sign or label, or any kind of identification.

[HEADER 00210003]
It was the door to the store cupboard.

[HEADER 002100A4]
Hey, now - you can't go in there.

[HEADER 002100A0]
Hey, I asked you not to go in there!

[HEADER 0021009E]
Hey...!

[HEADER 002100A5]
How come?

[HEADER 002100A6]
I'm responsible for the contents of that cupboard.

[HEADER 002100A1]
I know, but I'm curious.

[HEADER 002100A2]
Oh, no! I'm responsible for that cupboard and the contents.

[HEADER 002100A3]
Okay...

[HEADER 0021009F]
Okay...

[HEADER 00220000]
The nurse was stunningly beautiful. The guys on this ward sure were lucky to be in her care.

[HEADER 00220012]
Oui, m'sieur?

[HEADER 00220013]
Is this ward J-Two?

[HEADER 00220014]
It is, but you are not supposed to be here!

[HEADER 00220015]
We have strict rules about visiting hours.

[HEADER 00220016]
Can't you make an exception? I've come all the way from California!

[HEADER 00220017]
You must speak to the doctor...

[HEADER 00220018]
I can't wait that long. What if he snuffs it?

[HEADER 00220019]
You can't talk like that here! This is a hospital!

[HEADER 0022001A]
You will have to leave.

[HEADER 0022001B]
I told you to leave!

[HEADER 00220067]
You may come back at visiting time, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00220068]
Thanks. When is that?

[HEADER 00220069]
The second Tuesday of each month.

[HEADER 0022001C]
Okay, ma'am - I know when I'm not wanted.

[HEADER 0022002B]
Good afternoon, docteur.

[HEADER 0022002C]
Oh, hi. Is this ward J-Two?

[HEADER 0022002D]
Yes, Sir.

[HEADER 0022002E]
The patients are ready for your inspection, docteur

[HEADER 0022002F]
Uh - thank you, nurse.

[HEADER 00220034]
You'll need this, docteur...

[HEADER 00220035]
She gave me a long, narrow metal box and a stunning smile...

[HEADER 00220036]
Thanks.

[HEADER 00220025]
Could you take a look at the client in bed number three, now?

[HEADER 00220026]
His name is Eric Sopmarsh.

[HEADER 00220037]
Pardon me, nurse...

[HEADER 00220038]
Oui, m'sieur?

[HEADER 00220039]
Do you have a patient named Marquet on this ward?

[HEADER 0022003A]
Oui, m'sieur. He is in the private room at the end of the ward.

[HEADER 0022003B]
He has been placed in strict isolation.

[HEADER 0022003C]
Why is Marquet in quarantine?

[HEADER 0022003D]
If you wish to know more, you'll have to speak to Herr Hagenmeyer.

[HEADER 0022003E]
All I know is that Marquet's room is strictly out of bounds.

[HEADER 00220047]
Do you know who paid for Marquet's room?

[HEADER 00220048]
No, of course I don't!

[HEADER 00220049]
Preferential treatment like that must cost an arm and a leg...

[HEADER 0022004A]
That's not my concern, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0022004B]
Is it true that Marquet is suffering from anthrax?

[HEADER 0022004C]
Keep your voice down, m'sieur!

[HEADER 0022004D]
Who told you that?

[HEADER 0022004E]
The cop at the door.

[HEADER 0022004F]
It's not true. It can't be. Herr Hagenmeyer would have told me!

[HEADER 00220050]
Evacuate. That's it. No panic. Women and children first...

[HEADER 00220051]
Has anyone ever told you how cute you are when you go to pieces?

[HEADER 00220052]
So, what precautions do you intend to take to prevent the spread of anthrax?

[HEADER 00220053]
My first step will be to burn the bodies.

[HEADER 00220054]
Burn... the bodies?

[HEADER 00220055]
It won't be easy, I know, but I can do it!

[HEADER 00220056]
Just give me a chance, docteur! Let me burn the patients!

[HEADER 00220057]
I don't think that would be a good idea, Nurse Grendel.

[HEADER 00220058]
I'm sorry, docteur, but the other staff put me up to this.

[HEADER 00220059]
It's because you're new, you see. Traditional hospital humour.

[HEADER 0022005A]
Hilarious. Then Marquet hasn't got anthrax?

[HEADER 0022005B]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 0022005C]
Do you have any clowns on the ward?

[HEADER 0022005D]
Why, yes - we do. A professional clown.

[HEADER 0022005E]
I'll bet he lightens the place up!

[HEADER 0022005F]
Hardly. M'sieur Boissy has been in a coma for the last three months.

[HEADER 00220060]
What's wrong with Boissy?

[HEADER 00220061]
He was involved in a very nasty accident.

[HEADER 00220062]
A silly stunt involving a unicycle.

[HEADER 00220063]
His current condition is due to post-traumatic shock.

[HEADER 00220064]
It's unlikely he'll ever perform as a clown again...

[HEADER 00220065]
It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.

[HEADER 00220085]
Do you recognise this tissue?

[HEADER 00220086]
No, I don't! It looks like a chronic health risk to me!

[HEADER 00220087]
I've been carrying it around for days and I'm okay.

[HEADER 0022007D]
Do you want this, uh...

[HEADER 0022007E]
Device for measuring blood pressure?

[HEADER 0022007F]
Yeah. Do you want it back?

[HEADER 00220080]
No, thank you.

[HEADER 0022007B]
What is this device?

[HEADER 0022007C]
It's for taking the patient's blood pressure, docteur.

[HEADER 0022006F]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00220070]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 00220071]
Does this gem mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00220072]
It's beautiful, but I've never seen it before.

[HEADER 00220073]
Do you know Moerlin, of Grüber Electronics?

[HEADER 00220074]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 00220075]
Does this tool mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00220076]
I don't recognize it.

[HEADER 00220077]
Does this mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00220078]
The Club Alamut? I've never heard of it.

[HEADER 0022006B]
Do you recognize this red nose?

[HEADER 0022006C]
Oh, dear. I don't think he'll be needing that again!

[HEADER 0022006D]
Who?

[HEADER 0022006E]
M'sieur Boissy, the comatose clown.

[HEADER 00220079]
Is this plaster any use to you?

[HEADER 0022007A]
No, it isn't.

[HEADER 00220081]
Would you like to shake hands with me?

[HEADER 00220082]
Well...

[HEADER 00220083]
Okay, forget it.

[HEADER 00220066]
Thank you, nurse.

[HEADER 0022006A]
Au revoir, m'sieur!

[HEADER 0022001D]
Docteur!

[HEADER 0022001E]
What is it now, nurse?

[HEADER 0022001F]
Number two again. He won't tell me what he wants.

[HEADER 00220020]
He says he'll only talk to a man.

[HEADER 00220021]
Do I have to? That guy's nuts!

[HEADER 00220022]
Docteur, I'm surprised at you!

[HEADER 00220023]
That's no way to talk about our clients!

[HEADER 00220024]
Okay, okay - I'll see him, but I'm telling you - he's a hypochondriac.

[HEADER 00220027]
What's his problem?

[HEADER 00220028]
He's delirious. He just now came out of theatre.

[HEADER 00220029]
He's recovering from major surgery.

[HEADER 0022002A]
I'll have him up and about before you can say `Lazarus, get out of your bed and walk'!

[HEADER 00200003]
The young man's fresh face was full of eagerness and enthusiasm. I figured he was fresh from college.

[HEADER 00830001]
Hi! My name's George Stobbart.

[HEADER 00830000]
Hey - Benoir!

[HEADER 00830011]
Yes, Sir?

[HEADER 00830003]
So, what's your name, kid?

[HEADER 00830004]
Benoir. They call me Bunny.

[HEADER 00830005]
Bunny? Jeez! And you don't mind?

[HEADER 00830006]
I've gotten used to it.

[HEADER 00830007]
Okay, Benoir - you're gonna help me.

[HEADER 00830008]
Anything you say, Sir.

[HEADER 00830009]
Pleased to meet you, Sir.

[HEADER 0083000A]
Call me George, if you like.

[HEADER 0083000B]
Are you sure?

[HEADER 0083000C]
Yeah. That's my name.

[HEADER 0083000D]
My name's Benoir - but everyone calls me Bunny.

[HEADER 0083000E]
Bunny?

[HEADER 0083000F]
That's right. I used to have this cute habit when I was a kid.

[HEADER 00830010]
Keep it to yourself, Benoir.

[HEADER 00830027]
Do you know the nurse on ward J2?

[HEADER 00830028]
Non, Sir. This is my first day here.

[HEADER 00830029]
I can't wait to get my hands dirty!

[HEADER 0083002A]
I was talking about treating my first patient, of course.

[HEADER 0083002B]
I didn't mean I'd get my hands dirty with the nurse...

[HEADER 0083002C]
Shut up, Benoir.

[HEADER 0083002D]
Okay, Sir.

[HEADER 0083002E]
Do you know anything about a patient named Marquet?

[HEADER 0083002F]
No, Sir. I don't know much about any of the patients.

[HEADER 00830030]
I've never met a doctor who admits that he's only human...

[HEADER 00830031]
I'm only a trainee, Sir. I'm sure I'll get the hang of things.

[HEADER 00830032]
Do you know anything about anthrax, Bunny?

[HEADER 00830033]
Not much, Sir. I thought it was virtually wiped out...

[HEADER 00830034]
Maybe you'd like to put that to a practical test?

[HEADER 00830035]
Oh, no, Sir. Definitely not, Sir. Most emphatically not, Sir.

[HEADER 00830036]
I thought so.

[HEADER 00830037]
Underneath that starched waiter's uniform you're nothing but a worm.

[HEADER 00830038]
I really must object, Sir.

[HEADER 00830039]
Why don't you run along to Uncle Felix, huh?

[HEADER 0083003A]
Tell him you don't mind attending to his patients as long as they're only slightly ill?

[HEADER 0083003B]
Meanwhile, poor Marquet is up to his neck in some damned cow disease.

[HEADER 0083003C]
Marquet? He doesn't have anthrax. I heard Uncle Felix discussing his case.

[HEADER 0083003D]
It was a test, Benoir - and you failed it.

[HEADER 0083003E]
Now do try to look more like a man who holds people's lives in his hands.

[HEADER 0083003F]
I'll try, Sir, but I'll warn you - I'm hopeless at acting.

[HEADER 00830025]
Do you still have that gauge I gave you?

[HEADER 00830026]
Oh, yes. What do you want me to do with it?

[HEADER 00830014]
Use it on Nurse Grendel.

[HEADER 00830015]
Huh?

[HEADER 00830016]
Go on - she'll enjoy it.

[HEADER 00830017]
Well, okay...

[HEADER 00830018]
Docteur Stobbart!

[HEADER 00830019]
Yeah?

[HEADER 0083001A]
I would appreciate it if you saved your jokes for the interns' rest room.

[HEADER 0083001B]
This is a hospital ward, not a cabaret.

[HEADER 0083001C]
Aw, lighten up!

[HEADER 0083001D]
I heard that! Any more nonsense and I shall report you to Doctor Hagenmeyer!

[HEADER 0083001E]
Use it on Eric Sopmarsh.

[HEADER 0083001F]
Okay...

[HEADER 0083006E]
Keep it safe until I think of something.

[HEADER 0083006A]
Here, take this pressure gauge.

[HEADER 0083006B]
Thank you, Sir.

[HEADER 0083006C]
What do you want me to do with it?

[HEADER 0083006D]
Well...

[HEADER 00830059]
Shake my hand, Benoir.

[HEADER 0083005A]
I don't think that's a good idea, Sir.

[HEADER 0083005B]
How come?

[HEADER 0083005C]
Dermatitis.

[HEADER 0083005D]
I don't have dermatitis.

[HEADER 0083005E]
I do.

[HEADER 00830045]
What do you make of this ball?

[HEADER 00830046]
Oh perfait! We can have a game in the corridor later.

[HEADER 00830047]
Maybe not...

[HEADER 00830048]
Does this false nose mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00830049]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 0083004C]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 0083004D]
No, monsieur. I've never seen him before.

[HEADER 0083004E]
Does this gem mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0083004F]
Not me, Sir.

[HEADER 00830050]
Have you ever heard of a guy named Moerlin?

[HEADER 00830051]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 00830052]
What does this tool suggest to you?

[HEADER 00830053]
Isn't that used to snap the patient's ribs when exploring the abdomen?

[HEADER 00830055]
Have you ever heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 00830056]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 00830057]
Do you know what this white powder is?

[HEADER 00830058]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 00830060]
What does this tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 00830061]
Is that a nasal discharge, Sir?

[HEADER 00830062]
No, it's greasepaint.

[HEADER 00830063]
Do you recognize this tripod?

[HEADER 00830064]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 00830065]
Have you any idea what this cup is used for?

[HEADER 00830066]
Blood letting?

[HEADER 00830041]
Follow me, Benoir.

[HEADER 00830042]
I'm right behind you, Sir...

[HEADER 00830043]
See you later...

[HEADER 00830044]
Right.

[HEADER 00220001]
He sat like a statue of a sack of potatoes, but the cop's eyes were as watchful as a hawk's.

[HEADER 00220127]
Rather you than me, pal!

[HEADER 00220128]
I'm Doctor Stobbart.

[HEADER 00220129]
Bonjour, docteur.

[HEADER 0022012A]
Hello again.

[HEADER 0022012B]
Bonjour.

[HEADER 00220149]
I've got some good news for you...

[HEADER 0022014B]
You'll be pleased to know Marquet hasn't got anthrax.

[HEADER 0022014C]
I knew that. It was my idea in the first place.

[HEADER 0022013B]
Have you heard of a guy called Marquet?

[HEADER 0022013C]
He's in quarantine, doc. Right behind this here door.

[HEADER 0022013D]
Marquet is just the man I wanted to see.

[HEADER 0022013E]
I wouldn't go in there if I was you...

[HEADER 0022013F]
He has anthrax.

[HEADER 00220140]
I have to visit my patient.

[HEADER 00220141]
What for?

[HEADER 00220142]
Routine. I have to check he's still breathing.

[HEADER 00220143]
What if he's not?

[HEADER 00220144]
I'll sign the certificate and register his bed as vacant.

[HEADER 00220145]
That's a cold and distant attitude to death.

[HEADER 00220146]
I've been institutionalized to the point of godlike aloofness.

[HEADER 00220147]
The white coat suits you.

[HEADER 00220148]
Thanks.

[HEADER 0022012C]
Have you seen any suspicious characters on the ward?

[HEADER 0022012D]
Yeah - I have.

[HEADER 0022012E]
A gorilla and a weasel?

[HEADER 0022012F]
No! This was a tatty old bear.

[HEADER 00220130]
How was the bear acting suspiciously?

[HEADER 00220131]
Well... he was wearing a homburg...

[HEADER 00220132]
Is that against the law?

[HEADER 00220133]
No, but it's pretty weird for a bear.

[HEADER 00220165]
What does this tissue suggest to you?

[HEADER 00220166]
It looks as if it has been used to wipe Satan's bottom.

[HEADER 00220167]
I hate to say it, but you could be right...

[HEADER 0022015B]
What do you think this tool is used for?

[HEADER 0022015C]
Branding mice without bending down.

[HEADER 00220150]
Do you recognize this red nose?

[HEADER 00220151]
Don't get cute with me.

[HEADER 00220152]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00220153]
No, I've never seen him before.

[HEADER 00220154]
Do you recognize this gem?

[HEADER 00220155]
It isn't an emerald, is it?

[HEADER 00220156]
Uh... yeah, I think so.

[HEADER 00220158]
Are you Thomas Moerlin of Grüber Electronics?

[HEADER 00220159]
No.

[HEADER 0022015A]
Then you won't be needing this...

[HEADER 0022015D]
Have you ever heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 0022015E]
No. It sounds Middle-Eastern.

[HEADER 0022015F]
Can you think of any sensible use for this plaster?

[HEADER 00220160]
Sensible? No. Puerile? Yes - but you've probably thought of those yourself already.

[HEADER 00220161]
Would you like to shake hands?

[HEADER 00220162]
What for?

[HEADER 00220163]
As a gesture of goodwill...

[HEADER 00220164]
On reflection, no.

[HEADER 0022014D]
Catch you later, officer.

[HEADER 0022014E]
Au revoir, doc.

[HEADER 002200D7]
Oh, Doctor!

[HEADER 002200DF]
You haven't taken my blood pressure!

[HEADER 002200CF]
You haven't finished taking my blood pressure!

[HEADER 002200D0]
Will you keep quiet? You're disturbing the other patients.

[HEADER 002200D1]
I'll keep quiet when you've taken my blood pressure properly.

[HEADER 002200D2]
I have to see Jacques Marquet first...

[HEADER 002200D3]
How come he gets preferential treatment?

[HEADER 002200D4]
It's because he's got money, isn't it?

[HEADER 002200D6]
I'll come back when you've dealt with that chip on your shoulder...

[HEADER 002200D8]
What now?

[HEADER 002200D9]
You didn't finish taking my blood pressure!

[HEADER 002200DA]
Okay - let's try again...

[HEADER 002200DB]
You don't have the first idea what you're doing, do you?

[HEADER 002200DC]
I'll come back when you've recovered your manners.

[HEADER 002200DD]
Doctor!

[HEADER 002200DE]
What is it?

[HEADER 002200E0]
It seems fine to me...

[HEADER 002200E1]
You're not doing it right.

[HEADER 002200E2]
Of course I am.

[HEADER 002200E3]
No, you're not. Doctor Monroe never did it like that.

[HEADER 002200E4]
I can't take a satisfactory reading while you're excited like this.

[HEADER 002200E5]
I'll come back later...

[HEADER 00220005]
This guy didn't look sick to me.

[HEADER 00220006]
He didn't have spots, or stitches, and he certainly didn't have a fever...

[HEADER 002200E6]
Hello? Anybody home?

[HEADER 002200E7]
Who are you?

[HEADER 002200E8]
My name is Doctor Stobbart, and I'm here to steer you down the rocky road to recovery!

[HEADER 002200E9]
Doctor Monroe said there was no cure for what I've got...

[HEADER 002200EA]
Your problem is you stayed in bed too long.

[HEADER 002200EB]
Are you sure you're a qualified doctor?

[HEADER 002200EC]
You better believe it.

[HEADER 002200ED]
Hi - it's me again.

[HEADER 002200EE]
What's your impression of Nurse Grendel?

[HEADER 002200EF]
She's a very efficient young woman.

[HEADER 002200F0]
Efficient? You make her sound like a vacuum cleaner!

[HEADER 002200F1]
I've no complaints.

[HEADER 002200F2]
The woman in reception described Nurse Grendel as a monster...

[HEADER 002200F3]
Well, that's simply not true.

[HEADER 002200F4]
She's quite strict, but that's her job, isn't it?

[HEADER 002200F5]
You've got to have discipline in a place like this.

[HEADER 002200F6]
What can you tell me about Marquet?

[HEADER 002200F7]
He's the man in the private room, isn't he?

[HEADER 002200F8]
That room was mine before I was tossed out, like a common squatter!

[HEADER 002200F9]
Do you know what's wrong with Marquet?

[HEADER 002200FA]
They won't even say what's wrong with me!

[HEADER 002200FB]
Tell me, doctor - what's your opinion?

[HEADER 002200FC]
Uh... It's too early to say.

[HEADER 002200FD]
But I've been here for three months!

[HEADER 002200FF]
Do you recognize this red nose?

[HEADER 00220100]
Doesn't that belong to Boissy?

[HEADER 00220101]
No - I found it in a sewer.

[HEADER 00220102]
He's a clown, you know.

[HEADER 00220103]
You wouldn't think so to look at him now, would you?

[HEADER 00220104]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00220105]
No, doctor. Who is it?

[HEADER 00220106]
A cold-blooded killer.

[HEADER 0022010F]
Does this gem mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00220110]
No, doctor.

[HEADER 00220113]
Have you heard of a guy called Moerlin?

[HEADER 00220114]
No, doctor.

[HEADER 00220115]
Do you know what this tool is used for?

[HEADER 00220116]
I'd rather not, doctor.

[HEADER 00220118]
Have you ever heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 00220119]
I'm not really a nightclub man, doctor.

[HEADER 0022011B]
Do you know what this is?

[HEADER 0022011C]
It looks like plaster.

[HEADER 00220124]
Have you any idea what this is?

[HEADER 00220125]
No, doctor. I wouldn't even like to guess.

[HEADER 0022011F]
I'm going to take your blood pressure...

[HEADER 00220120]
Why?

[HEADER 00220121]
I'm a doctor - it's my job.

[HEADER 0023000B]
Marquet?

[HEADER 0023000C]
Yes, I'm Marquet. I've been expecting you...

[HEADER 0023000D]
You have?

[HEADER 0023000E]
Well, what are you waiting for? Get it over with!

[HEADER 0023000F]
I just want to know what I should do with the gem.

[HEADER 00230010]
The Lochmarne gem...?

[HEADER 00230011]
Yeah. Right here in my pocket.

[HEADER 00230012]
I thought you were one of the Hashshashin!

[HEADER 00230013]
Not me.

[HEADER 00230014]
I never inhaled.

[HEADER 00230015]
So... you were sent in my place?

[HEADER 00230016]
Uh... yeah. You could hardly make the trip to Ireland in your condition.

[HEADER 00230017]
What should I do with the gem?

[HEADER 00230018]
Deliver it to the Grand Master, quickly!

[HEADER 00230019]
Tell him that I've found the tripod - right here, in Paris.

[HEADER 0023001A]
You have it?

[HEADER 0023001B]
Not yet, but it's being taken care of.

[HEADER 0023001C]
I've hired a couple of stooges with a flair for petty crime.

[HEADER 0023001D]
Would that be Flap and Guido, by any chance?

[HEADER 0023001E]
You know them?

[HEADER 00230025]
As for Klausner, he's gone off to Syria on a wild-goose chase!

[HEADER 00230026]
They have geese in Syria?

[HEADER 00230027]
He has a theory about the location of the...

[HEADER 00230028]
That's enough excitement for one day, M'sieur Marquet...

[HEADER 00230029]
What are you doing here?

[HEADER 0023002A]
Talking to this patient, of course.

[HEADER 0023002B]
M'sieur Marquet is my patient.

[HEADER 0023002C]
If Herr Hagenmeyer was to hear that...

[HEADER 0023002D]
Okay! I'm going.

[HEADER 0023002E]
I'd learned all I could from Marquet anyhow.

[HEADER 0023002F]
There you are, Sir! I was just coming to look for you.

[HEADER 00230030]
I've finished with your pressure gauge.

[HEADER 00230031]
Thanks, Bunny.

[HEADER 00230032]
What's that noise? It sounds as if someone's having a cardiac arrest!

[HEADER 00230033]
It's all right - the doctor is in there with him.

[HEADER 00230034]
Are you sure he was a doctor?

[HEADER 00230035]
Oui, m'sieur! He showed me his ID. It was Docteur Braille.

[HEADER 00230036]
There's no Docteur Braille working here.

[HEADER 00230037]
He's an impostor!

[HEADER 00230038]
The door's locked! Help me, officer!

[HEADER 00230039]
Stand back, messieurs!

[HEADER 00210008]
It was a classic example of functionalism, like an early Soviet spacecraft.

[HEADER 00210009]
I almost expected to see a dog or a monkey leap out...

[HEADER 0021000B]
He looked blissfully happy, for no apparent reason.

[HEADER 0021000C]
The janitor's face was a mask of sadness and pain, like his best friend had just died...

[HEADER 002100AA]
Hello!

[HEADER 002100AB]
What's that?

[HEADER 002100AC]
I said: Hello!

[HEADER 002100AD]
Oh - hiya!

[HEADER 002100AE]
I'd like to talk to you for a minute...

[HEADER 002100AF]
That's what I thought you said.

[HEADER 002100B0]
Don't look so down-in-the-mouth!

[HEADER 002100B1]
No matter how bad things seem, I never let life get on top of me!

[HEADER 002100B2]
Oh, yeah? What's your secret?

[HEADER 002100B3]
Why - it's easy! All you have to do is smile - and whistle this little tune...

[HEADER 002100B4]
You know what? If you start whistling I'll bust you in the teeth.

[HEADER 002100B5]
It's a deal!

[HEADER 002100B6]
Oh, hi!

[HEADER 002100B7]
No whistling, right?

[HEADER 002100B8]
Right.

[HEADER 002100B9]
Do you know where I'd find a patient called Marquet?

[HEADER 002100BA]
No. I'm not allowed on the wards with Mr. Shiny.

[HEADER 002100BB]
Have you seen any unsavoury characters lurking about in the corridors?

[HEADER 002100BC]
No, Sir, I haven't, but I've got nothing to worry about.

[HEADER 002100BD]
What's that, Mr. Shiny? You'd take good care of the rascals? I'll bet you would!

[HEADER 002100BE]
With a friend like him I've no fear of oppressors!

[HEADER 002100BF]
It must be a great comfort.

[HEADER 002100C0]
He is.

[HEADER 002100CF]
Are you having trouble with Mr. Shiny?

[HEADER 002100D0]
Yes, I am! I don't know what's got into him today.

[HEADER 002100D1]
He keeps pullin' his plug.

[HEADER 002100C4]
How come you got so attached to a polishing machine?

[HEADER 002100C5]
I asked you not to call him that.

[HEADER 002100C6]
He's got a name, you know.

[HEADER 002100C7]
Uh... yeah. Mr. Shiny.

[HEADER 002100C8]
It's just that...

[HEADER 002100C9]
You think it's odd, don't you?

[HEADER 002100CB]
I don't mind. The rest of the staff think I'm twisted.

[HEADER 002100CC]
I heard them, snorking behind my back when I gave Mr. Shiny his weekly pull-through...

[HEADER 002100C1]
Would `Mr. Shiny' be your polishing machine, by any chance?

[HEADER 002100C2]
Please - don't call him that. He's more of a friend than a machine.

[HEADER 002100C3]
I've had Mr. Shiny for three years, and he's never let me down once!

[HEADER 002100E2]
What's the problem with nurse Grendel?

[HEADER 002100E3]
She's uptight and twisted, on account of a broken heart.

[HEADER 002100E4]
Aw, that's too bad. I thought she was just plain bad-tempered.

[HEADER 002100E5]
That also. By the way, Sir - I wouldn't stand too close to Mr. Shiny's grease valve.

[HEADER 002100E6]
If he has an emission it'll take the shine clean off your shoes.

[HEADER 002100E7]
Say  - nice sneakers!

[HEADER 002100E8]
Thanks.

[HEADER 002100F2]
Take a look at this red nose...

[HEADER 002100F3]
Are you a policeman?.

[HEADER 002100F4]
No. This is a clown's nose, not a policeman's

[HEADER 00210118]
Do you recognize this matchbook?

[HEADER 00210119]
You should never, ever play with matches.

[HEADER 0021011A]
I know that, but...

[HEADER 0021011B]
People get hurt when they do.

[HEADER 0021011D]
They end up in hospital like the burger-lady.

[HEADER 0021011E]
She was so burned-up they didn't know whether to use bandages or onions.

[HEADER 00210085]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00210126]
Who is it?

[HEADER 00210127]
That's what I'm asking you. Have you seen him before?

[HEADER 00210128]
How should I know? You haven't told me who he is!

[HEADER 00210129]
Take a look at the photo.

[HEADER 0021012A]
Yeah. Okay.

[HEADER 0021012B]
Now, have you seen him before?

[HEADER 00210039]
No.

[HEADER 002100FE]
Would this tool be any use to you?

[HEADER 002100FF]
No, Sir. Mr. Shiny has no user-serviceable parts.

[HEADER 00210100]
Whatever that means...

[HEADER 00210101]
Do you recognize this pass?

[HEADER 00210102]
No, I don't. Should I?

[HEADER 00210103]
No, but I wondered if you'd seen a stranger flashing it about...

[HEADER 00210104]
No, Sir. But if I had, Mr. Shiny would take care of him.

[HEADER 00210105]
Would you like to shake my hand?

[HEADER 00210106]
Not until I've washed if you don't mind, Sir.

[HEADER 0021009C]
What does this tissue suggest to you?

[HEADER 0021010B]
You have a cold. What you need is vitamin C!

[HEADER 0021010D]
What do you think of this, Sam?

[HEADER 0021010E]
Oh, boy!

[HEADER 0021010F]
What is it?

[HEADER 00210110]
A priceless gemstone, found in a medieval castle in Ireland.

[HEADER 00210111]
Get me into Marquet's ward and it's yours.

[HEADER 00210112]
I don't wear jewellery.

[HEADER 00210113]
If this gem was yours you'd be able to buy a hundred Mr. Shinys!

[HEADER 00210114]
Don't be silly!

[HEADER 00210115]
There's only one Mr. Shiny!

[HEADER 0021011F]
Do you recognise this powder?

[HEADER 00210120]
Is that dandruff...?

[HEADER 00210121]
No way!

[HEADER 00210122]
It sure looks like dandruff.

[HEADER 00210123]
It's plaster.

[HEADER 00210124]
Ugh!

[HEADER 00210077]
See you later...

[HEADER 002100F1]
Yeah! Take care, now.
