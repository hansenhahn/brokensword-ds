Sean Fitzgerald is hiding something - but I can't figure out exactly what.

[HEADER 0000302A]
Try checking out his story with Liam Maguire.

[HEADER 00003034]
Each time Fitzgerald tells you something, check whether Maguire's version is the same. If not, challenge Fitzgerald until he panics and runs out.

[HEADER 00003022]
The gem fell into the cellar. How can I get down there?

[HEADER 00003023]
Maybe the grate opens from the other side.

[HEADER 00003024]
You need to persuade the barman to let you down.

[HEADER 00003025]
Pull the switch by the grate, then order a pint.

[HEADER 00003036]
The old poacher has some wire - but he's very protective of it.

[HEADER 00003037]
Ask the poacher about his wire.

[HEADER 00003038]
Occasionally the poacher puts the wire down.

[HEADER 0000303A]
Wait for the poacher to have one of his sneezing fits and then grab his piece of wire.

[HEADER 00003069]
The barman wants my help with the washer.

[HEADER 0000306A]
Something's wrong with the wiring. You need... some wire.

[HEADER 0000306B]
The fuse has probably blown. Replace the fuse in the plug with the wire. Now you can get access to the cellar.

[HEADER 0000303E]
The hay doesn't reach high enough!

[HEADER 00003040]
Climbing this wall is going to need more than hay.

[HEADER 00003042]
What do you have that could make a handy step?

[HEADER 00003044]
Put the lifting tool into the hole in the wall.

[HEADER 00003048]
This goat keeps knocking me over!

[HEADER 00003052]
If the goat's tether was to become ensnared...

[HEADER 0000305C]
What object could be used to trap the goat's tether?

[HEADER 00003066]
Pull the plough across to entangle the goat.

[HEADER 00003070]
I need some way to open this panel.

[HEADER 0000307A]
Having knocked the statue over, pick it back up - you will see there are some holes in the sand. Maybe those holes are the key to this problem.

[HEADER 00003084]
The holes - not sure what use they are.

[HEADER 0000308E]
You need to make a cast of the holes.

[HEADER 00003098]
Have you found the plaster of Paris on the right? Sprinkle it into the holes.

[HEADER 000030A2]
The plaster is in the holes, but I need some water.

[HEADER 000030AC]
There was a sink in the pub cellar, wasn't there?

[HEADER 000030B6]
You'll need something that can soak up water.

[HEADER 000030C0]
On the bar is a towel - grab that.

[HEADER 000030CA]
Soak the towel in water, then get back before it dries, and wring it out over the plaster.

[HEADER 0014000F]
It was a beer-stained piece of towelling.

[HEADER 0014000D]
The young red-haired guy was plainly nervous about something...

[HEADER 001403EB]
My name's George.

[HEADER 001403EC]
Pleased to meet you, mister.

[HEADER 001403EF]
My name's Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 001403E7]
Mister Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 001403F3]
What can you tell me about the castle?

[HEADER 001403F4]
There's nothing there, just an old ruin.

[HEADER 001403F5]
How old?

[HEADER 001403F6]
I really couldn't tell you.

[HEADER 001403F7]
Have you ever explored the castle yourself?

[HEADER 001403F8]
I used to play there sometimes, when I was a kid.

[HEADER 001403F9]
Then one of the littlun's fell off the wall, broke his head and died...

[HEADER 001403FA]
We didn't go there any more.

[HEADER 001403FB]
You haven't been up there recently?

[HEADER 001403FC]
No.

[HEADER 00140406]
Do you know Professor Peagram?

[HEADER 00140407]
He's the archaeologist, isn't he?

[HEADER 00140408]
That's right.

[HEADER 0014040C]
So where did Peagram go?

[HEADER 0014040D]
I don't know, I swear it.

[HEADER 0014040E]
He came to see me, early this morning. Said he was leaving.

[HEADER 0014040F]
He asked me to give this package to a guy called Marquet.

[HEADER 00140410]
Did you work at Professor Peagram's dig?

[HEADER 00140411]
Ha-ha! What gave you that idea?

[HEADER 0014041B]
Doyle told me you definitely worked at the dig.

[HEADER 0014041C]
He's seen you there. You might as well admit it.

[HEADER 00140416]
Maguire says he SAW you working at the dig...

[HEADER 00140417]
What's more, he saw you talking with Peagram.

[HEADER 0014041A]
I knew this would happen. I knew I'd get caught...

[HEADER 001403DB]
I need to talk to Professor Peagram, if he's still alive.

[HEADER 001403DC]
What do you mean? Is he in danger?

[HEADER 001403DD]
Yeah - you too, if I'm right.

[HEADER 001403DE]
You're not from the Social Security?

[HEADER 001403DF]
Hell, no. What makes you think that?

[HEADER 001403E0]
Well, I was claiming benefit at the same time I was working for Peagram.

[HEADER 001403E1]
I'm not in a position to make judgement, Sean.

[HEADER 001403E2]
That's between you and your conscience.

[HEADER 001403E3]
All I want is to talk to Peagram about the gem.

[HEADER 001403E4]
But he's not here!

[HEADER 001403E5]
I know that, but he left that package with you, didn't he?

[HEADER 00140426]
Show me what's in the package, Sean...

[HEADER 00140427]
I... I can't do that.

[HEADER 00140428]
Why not?

[HEADER 00140429]
I promised the Professor.

[HEADER 0014042A]
So what? You didn't have any qualms about your benefit scam...

[HEADER 0014042B]
...so where's the harm in taking a peek inside Peagram's package?

[HEADER 0014042C]
You don't know these people! I can't! I don't dare!

[HEADER 0014042D]
This is your last chance to show me the package, Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 0014042E]
I've been patient with you, but now it's time to kick ass.

[HEADER 0014042F]
But he'll kill me!

[HEADER 00140430]
Who will?

[HEADER 00140431]
The man from Paris - Jacques Marquet.

[HEADER 00140432]
Peagram told me if I gave him the package, unopened, I'd hear no more about it.

[HEADER 00140433]
But if I double crossed Marquet, I'd be dead.

[HEADER 00140434]
I'll deal with Jacques Marquet.

[HEADER 00140435]
Give the package to me.

[HEADER 00140436]
No! Why should I trust you?

[HEADER 00140437]
I don't know who to trust any more!

[HEADER 00140438]
I wish I'd never even HEARD of the Lochmarne gem!

[HEADER 00140287]
Hey! I just seen a big red...

[HEADER 00140288]
Get out of here, Maguire!

[HEADER 00140289]
Come back when you're old enough!

[HEADER 0014028A]
What's the lad howling about?

[HEADER 0014028B]
A big red sports car!

[HEADER 0014028C]
Sean Fitzgerald's been runned over!

[HEADER 0014028D]
Get OUT!

[HEADER 0014028E]
Noisy little tyke.

[HEADER 0014028F]
Maybe you should send out some medicinal brandy, Michael...

[HEADER 00140290]
Oh, yes! And who's going to pay for it?

[HEADER 00140291]
Not me!

[HEADER 00140292]
Me too, neither!

[HEADER 00140423]
Can I get you another drink?

[HEADER 00140424]
Oh - no, thank you! I shouldn't be drinking at all.

[HEADER 00140425]
I'm on tablets for my nerves. More than a pint and I'll pass out!

[HEADER 0014043E]
What does this red nose suggest to you?

[HEADER 0014043F]
Blood!

[HEADER 00140440]
Why is that?

[HEADER 00140441]
I used to bleed a lot when I was a kid.

[HEADER 00140442]
Every time there was a playground scrap I'd end up with a bloody nose.

[HEADER 00140443]
I wouldn't have minded, but I wasn't even involved in the scraps.

[HEADER 00140447]
Nothing.

[HEADER 00140448]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 0014044B]
No, I'm sure I don't know him.

[HEADER 0014044E]
Check out this pass...

[HEADER 00140451]
Thomas Moerlin... No, never heard of him.

[HEADER 0014044C]
What do you suppose this wire is used for?

[HEADER 0014044D]
How should I know?

[HEADER 0014043B]
Ever seen this towel before?

[HEADER 0014043C]
Doesn't it belong on the bar...?

[HEADER 0014043D]
Very observant, Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 00140452]
What do you think this tool is used for?

[HEADER 00140453]
Uh... something to do with horses?

[HEADER 00140454]
Wrong. It's for opening manhole covers.

[HEADER 00140455]
Oh. Really? Well, you learn something every day.

[HEADER 00140458]
Did I show you this tool?

[HEADER 00140459]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 0014045A]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0014045B]
No.

[HEADER 0014045C]
Shake my hand.

[HEADER 0014045D]
It's a trick, isn't it?

[HEADER 0014045E]
Dammit, you're right. I can't seem to fool anyone...

[HEADER 0014045F]
What does this tissue suggest to you?

[HEADER 00140460]
Nothing...

[HEADER 0014043A]
See you later...

[HEADER 00140009]
The guy sat in the corner as if he was a permanent fixture.

[HEADER 0014000A]
I'd been taught not to judge people by their appearance or their clothes or the length of their hair...

[HEADER 0014000B]
Nobody ever said anything about runny noses.

[HEADER 0014035C]
Hi there, old timer!

[HEADER 0014035E]
What?

[HEADER 0014035F]
Nasty cold you've got there!

[HEADER 00140360]
As soon as the words left my lips I regretted them.

[HEADER 00140361]
Is there such a thing as a cold which isn't nasty?

[HEADER 00140362]
I put the question to Father Mahoney.

[HEADER 00140363]
Father, says I, why were we born to suffer snot?

[HEADER 00140364]
What did he say?

[HEADER 00140365]
He said it's my reward for being out all night like a sinner.

[HEADER 00140366]
Pious prig.

[HEADER 00140367]
Anyway - this is no ordinary cold - 'tis the Hay Fever.

[HEADER 00140368]
Pollinosis?

[HEADER 00140369]
Thank you. You're not a policeman, are you?

[HEADER 0014036A]
Excuse me?

[HEADER 0014036B]
Police. No - I'd know it if you were...

[HEADER 0014035D]
Hello, again...

[HEADER 001403C5]
Here - this wire belongs to you.

[HEADER 001403C6]
Oh, no. Never saw it before, no.

[HEADER 0014039E]
What's that you're making?

[HEADER 0014039F]
It's a necklace, me buko.

[HEADER 001403A0]
Oh, sure. Made out of steel wire?

[HEADER 001403A1]
Heh-heh! That's right - a necklace for my pretty one!

[HEADER 001403A2]
When my little lover feels it round her slender neck she'll be mine, all mine!

[HEADER 001403A3]
HEH-HEH-HEH-HEH!

[HEADER 001403A4]
If I was a woman I wouldn't think much of a wire necklace...

[HEADER 001403A5]
It's not made for a woman!

[HEADER 001403A6]
I've got my sights on tastier dishes than women!

[HEADER 001403A7]
Flesh as smooth and tender as a maiden's!

[HEADER 001403A8]
Bones as soft and white as a new-born babe's!

[HEADER 001403A9]
Rabbit, lad. That's what gets my juices flowin'!

[HEADER 001403AA]
HEH-HEH-HEH-HEH!

[HEADER 001403AB]
Ah, so you're making snares to trap rabbits.

[HEADER 001403AC]
That's right. Do you have a problem with that?

[HEADER 001403AD]
Damned right I do! Isn't it painful?

[HEADER 001403AE]
Only if I get my fingers caught.

[HEADER 001403AF]
I'm talking about the rabbits! Do they feel much pain?

[HEADER 001403B0]
You bet!

[HEADER 001403B1]
HEH-HEH-HEH-HEH!

[HEADER 0014036D]
Can I buy you a beer?

[HEADER 0014036E]
Very kind, I'm sure, but I don't drink the stuff Leary sells.

[HEADER 0014036F]
What's wrong with it?

[HEADER 00140370]
I've seen what it can do.

[HEADER 00140377]
Can you tell me how to get into the castle?

[HEADER 00140378]
Don't even think about it, me buko. Lochmarne castle... is haunted!

[HEADER 00140379]
That's what the kid outside told me, but I don't believe it!

[HEADER 0014037A]
Then you're a fool.

[HEADER 0014037B]
Ghosts don't bother me. I still want to visit the castle.

[HEADER 0014037C]
You can't. It's not open to the public.

[HEADER 0014037D]
There's no-one around to stop me, is there?

[HEADER 0014037E]
That's right. Nothing human, anyhow...

[HEADER 00140390]
Have you ever seen the ghost?

[HEADER 00140391]
To be sure - with me very own eyes!

[HEADER 00140392]
Can you describe the ghost?

[HEADER 00140393]
It was horrible! A wee stunted beast  - long beak, straggly, flappy wings...

[HEADER 00140394]
Are you sure it wasn't a wild animal - a rabbit or a... skunk, or something?

[HEADER 00140395]
Skunk? In Lochmarne? That'll be the day...

[HEADER 00140396]
No, that was a ghost to be sure.

[HEADER 00140397]
I think I know what you saw on the castle wall...

[HEADER 00140398]
I know what I saw.

[HEADER 00140399]
I don't think so. It was the kid, Maguire.

[HEADER 0014039A]
What?!

[HEADER 0014039B]
He was up on the wall last Tuesday night.

[HEADER 0014039C]
He thought YOU were the Phantom of Lochmarne!

[HEADER 0014039D]
Oh.

[HEADER 0014037F]
Do you know Peagram, the archaeologist?

[HEADER 00140380]
That's the scrawny fella who was pokin' around at the castle, isn't it?

[HEADER 00140381]
No, I don't know him.

[HEADER 00140384]
I'm looking for Sean Fitzgerald... have you seen him?

[HEADER 00140385]
Never heard o' him!

[HEADER 00140386]
Don't you come from 'round here?.

[HEADER 00140387]
None o' your business. I didn't ask where you come from, did I?

[HEADER 00140388]
I'm from California.

[HEADER 00140389]
That's your problem.

[HEADER 0014038A]
Did you ever see Fitzgerald at Peagram's dig?

[HEADER 0014038B]
I never heard of either of 'em.

[HEADER 001403B3]
What do you think of this flashlight?

[HEADER 001403B4]
Very useful.

[HEADER 001403B5]
That could be very handy in the dark.

[HEADER 001403B6]
How much do you want for it?

[HEADER 001403B7]
It's not for sale. It belongs to Leary.

[HEADER 001403B8]
Did I show you this flashlight?

[HEADER 001403B9]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 001403BA]
Could you use this towel?

[HEADER 001403BB]
I could, but it wouldn't be much use for anything else!

[HEADER 001403BC]
What does this red nose mean to you?

[HEADER 001403C0]
Nothin'.

[HEADER 001403C1]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 001403C4]
I can't tell without my glasses.

[HEADER 001403C7]
What does this gem mean to you?

[HEADER 001403C8]
Well, well - would you look at that. Pretty.

[HEADER 001403C9]
Do you recognize it?

[HEADER 001403CA]
No.

[HEADER 001403CB]
Take a look at this ID card...

[HEADER 001403CF]
I don't know anythin' about it.

[HEADER 001403D0]
Can you identify this tool?

[HEADER 001403D1]
No.

[HEADER 001403D2]
What does this matchbook mean to you?

[HEADER 001403D3]
Nothing. Go away and stop bothering me.

[HEADER 001403D4]
What do you make of this white powder...?

[HEADER 001403D5]
Arrrgh!

[HEADER 001403D6]
Hay fever!

[HEADER 001403D7]
Hey! Would you like to shake my, unh... No, on second thought, forget it.

[HEADER 001403D8]
You could make use of this tissue...

[HEADER 001403D9]
Never use 'em. Those things are unhygienic.

[HEADER 001403B2]
See you later...

[HEADER 00130006]
The plastic cover had been smashed and broken away, revealing a switch.

[HEADER 00130005]
It was a featureless plastic box, firmly attached to the wall of the building.

[HEADER 00130008]
I tugged at the plastic cover, but it didn't move.

[HEADER 00130009]
I pushed the switch down, but in doing so it snapped off in my hand.

[HEADER 0013000A]
It was impossible to return the switch to its original position.

[HEADER 00130003]
The lad was doing his best to express his adolescent aggression.

[HEADER 00130004]
His effort was somewhat diminished by the fringe of milk on his lightly feathered upper lip.

[HEADER 0013002A]
Hi there!

[HEADER 0013002C]
What?

[HEADER 0013002D]
What's your name, kid?

[HEADER 0013002E]
Who are you callin' kid? Who the hell are you?

[HEADER 0013002F]
I'm George Stobbart, and I'm with the good guys.

[HEADER 00130030]
You're a head case, mister!

[HEADER 00130031]
A few sandwiches short of a picnic!!

[HEADER 00130032]
Rosso's the name - Murder's my game.

[HEADER 00130033]
You a detective?

[HEADER 00130034]
Let's just say I'm here to find the truth.

[HEADER 00130035]
Cool! Just like on the telly!

[HEADER 00130036]
Cut the crap and tell me your name.

[HEADER 00130037]
Liam Maguire.

[HEADER 00130038]
What are you doing hanging around the bar, Maguire?

[HEADER 00130039]
I'm on the run. From me dad.

[HEADER 0013003A]
Why? Did you do something bad?

[HEADER 0013003B]
I ain't done nothin', boss!

[HEADER 0013003C]
You can tell me, kid. Is it your dad?

[HEADER 0013003D]
Oh, Sir - he drinks! Every last penny - down his evil throat.

[HEADER 0013003E]
An' there's me poor old mother - bed-ridden an' dyin' o' presumption.

[HEADER 0013003F]
I tried to buy her medicine; chopped firewood for Father Mahoney 'til me fingers bled.

[HEADER 00130040]
The old skinflint cheated me too, but I took the pennies he gave me back home.

[HEADER 00130041]
Look ma! says I, See what your darlin' son has earnt with his own sweat an' blood!

[HEADER 00130042]
When suddenly me dad appears an' grabs the loot.

[HEADER 00130043]
I'm off to Dublin, heavy drinkin', says he. Watch out till I get back!

[HEADER 00130044]
That's why I runned away.

[HEADER 00130045]
Something in the grin on his face told me he wasn't being strictly truthful.

[HEADER 00130046]
Compared to him, Huckleberry Finn was a candidate for altar boy of the year.

[HEADER 0013002B]
Hey, Maguire!

[HEADER 00130084]
Do you know a man called Peagram?

[HEADER 00130085]
Can you describe him like on the telly in the cop shows?

[HEADER 00130086]
He's an English archaeologist.

[HEADER 00130087]
I know the man you mean if he's the one.

[HEADER 00130088]
Can you tell me where I'd find Peagram?

[HEADER 00130089]
No, I can't cos' he's not here now, but if I sees him I'll ask him.

[HEADER 0013008A]
Do you know what Peagram was doing in the castle?

[HEADER 0013008B]
Diggin' for buried treasure! Jewels an' gold an' skeletons, like in the films.

[HEADER 00130092]
Do you know anything about Peagram's dig?

[HEADER 00130093]
He wouldn't let me anywhere near it!

[HEADER 00130094]
I offered t'help, but he chased me off!

[HEADER 00130095]
I didn't want t'see his smelly old hole anyhow.

[HEADER 00130096]
Did anyone from the village work at the dig?

[HEADER 00130097]
Peagram brought some students and bums with him.

[HEADER 00130098]
He reckoned no-one in Lochmarne would know what t' look for.

[HEADER 00130099]
The only local guy who worked for him was Sean Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 0013009A]
Fitzgerald says he's never been anywhere near the dig!

[HEADER 0013009B]
He's havin' you on, mister!

[HEADER 0013009C]
What does this Fitzgerald guy look like?

[HEADER 0013009D]
Big head, big ears, an' face irons.

[HEADER 0013009E]
What?

[HEADER 0013009F]
Y'know - speccy-tacles. Glasses. He's blind as a bat without 'em.

[HEADER 001300A0]
Are you sure Fitzgerald worked at the dig?

[HEADER 001300A1]
Oh, yes - it was him all right. Would I tell a lie?

[HEADER 001300A2]
Well, he denies it.

[HEADER 001300A3]
I saw them together only last night!

[HEADER 001300A4]
I wish you'd told me that sooner! What were they doing?

[HEADER 001300A5]
Peagram gave Fitzy a box. He didn't look too happy about it.

[HEADER 001300A6]
I knew it! But how am I going to persuade him to part with it?

[HEADER 001300A7]
Break his fingers!

[HEADER 001300A8]
Nah, I couldn't do that.

[HEADER 001300A9]
I could.

[HEADER 001300AA]
Thanks for the offer, kid, but I'll try a more subtle approach.

[HEADER 001300AB]
Chinese burns?

[HEADER 00130071]
What can you tell me about the castle, Maguire?

[HEADER 00130072]
What do you want to know?

[HEADER 00130073]
Well... can I get inside?

[HEADER 00130074]
No - it's locked up.

[HEADER 00130075]
Does anyone live there?

[HEADER 00130076]
No.

[HEADER 00130077]
Only...

[HEADER 00130078]
What?

[HEADER 00130079]
Oh, nothin'...

[HEADER 0013007A]
You know something about the castle you're not telling, don't you?

[HEADER 0013007B]
No...

[HEADER 0013007C]
What is it you're covering up? Is it something you're scared of?

[HEADER 0013007D]
I ain't scared of nothin'.

[HEADER 0013007E]
I'll give you one last chance to tell me about the castle...

[HEADER 0013007F]
Oh, yeah? An' what if I don't?

[HEADER 00130080]
Then I'm taking you back to school.

[HEADER 00130081]
Oh.

[HEADER 00130082]
There's a ghost.

[HEADER 00130083]
It's called the Phantom o' Lochmarne!

[HEADER 00130049]
You're not telling me you believe in ghosts, are you?

[HEADER 0013004A]
Mister, I seen it with me very own eyes!

[HEADER 0013004B]
Last Tuesday night I went up to see what that dig was about.

[HEADER 0013004C]
I just reached the top o' the wall when I hears this awful noise!

[HEADER 0013004D]
What sort of noise?

[HEADER 0013004E]
A horrible snufflin' and snortin' - like O'Brien's pig, only wurst.

[HEADER 0013004F]
It was comin' from inside the castle!

[HEADER 00130050]
Did you find out what was making the noise in the castle?

[HEADER 00130051]
No fear! I just sat dere on the wall like Humpy Dumpy.

[HEADER 00130052]
The moon was cracked an' greasy like an old dinner plate.

[HEADER 00130053]
The yard was full o'shadows that could be hidin' anyting.

[HEADER 00130054]
I would've gone home, but me legs had lost their stuffin'!

[HEADER 00130055]
Did you get to see the ghost?

[HEADER 00130056]
Indeed I did, and a fearsome sight it is too...!

[HEADER 00130057]
I sat on me arse, waited while the moon went down, den out it comes from the shadows...

[HEADER 00130058]
All gray an' tattered an' hunched over like an old bent willow.

[HEADER 00130059]
Then I hears this splutterin' an' splashin' an' a horrible laughter in the dark.

[HEADER 0013005A]
I was so scared - why, I fell off the bloody wall!

[HEADER 0013005F]
I'm sure there's a rational explanation for what you saw at the castle.

[HEADER 00130060]
There is - the bloody place is haunted.

[HEADER 00130065]
Have you seen a guy dressed as a clown?

[HEADER 00130066]
Here in Lochmarne? They all dress like clowns.

[HEADER 00130067]
The man I'm looking for is a dangerous psychotic.

[HEADER 00130068]
Jaysus! It's just like that film I saw...

[HEADER 00130069]
There's dis clown, see - an' he's after this kid who saw him kill a guy.

[HEADER 0013006A]
He tries to warn the sheriff, only no-one believes him.

[HEADER 0013006B]
Then while he's in the tub the clown cuts him up with a chain-saw...

[HEADER 0013006C]
My God! That doesn't sound suitable for a kid like you!

[HEADER 0013006D]
Who are you callin' a kid? I'm twenty-five!

[HEADER 0013006E]
Yea right! You're not a day over fourteen!

[HEADER 0013006F]
Oh, no - it's twenty-five dat I am. Married, with a car and three kids.

[HEADER 00130070]
Ten kids, if you count the wife's...

[HEADER 001300B8]
Did this Pixie have a scar on his cheek?

[HEADER 001300B9]
I coudn't see. He was wearin' a stupid mask.

[HEADER 001300BA]
Are you a special agent?

[HEADER 001300BB]
Sorry to disappoint you, kid, but I'm not.

[HEADER 001300BC]
I'm just an ordinary guy caught up in a whirlpool of intrigue.

[HEADER 001300BD]
And you're drunk.

[HEADER 001300BE]
Not so.

[HEADER 001300BF]
Y'are! You've bin drinkin' mucky beer in the boozer!

[HEADER 001300C0]
Only a few glasses...

[HEADER 001300B6]
Did Fitzgerald drop anything when he was hit?

[HEADER 001300B7]
I didn't see. It all happened so fast!

[HEADER 00001E32]
Maybe the package fell somewhere out of sight...

[HEADER 001300C1]
Did you get the registration of the car that hit Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 001300C2]
Ah, no - there were too many numbers to remember.

[HEADER 001300C3]
But it had a sticker - with a fish on it.

[HEADER 001300C4]
A whale? That's not going to help me trace it!

[HEADER 001300C5]
There must be more cars with save the whale stickers than there are whales in the ocean!

[HEADER 001300C6]
That was no whale, mister. It was more like a trout!

[HEADER 001300C7]
I had a feeling he was making fun of me, but I wasn't about to take the bait.

[HEADER 001300CA]
What do you think of my flashlight?

[HEADER 001300CB]
It's a torch. That's what we call it on this side of the Atlantic.

[HEADER 001300CC]
What do you make of this, kid?

[HEADER 001300CD]
Hey - that's one of Leary's towels! He'll skin you alive!

[HEADER 001300CE]
That old windbag doesn't scare me. Anyhow - I'm only borrowing it.

[HEADER 001300CF]
You're pretty cool, mister - for an old guy.

[HEADER 001300D0]
Have you ever seen anyone wearing one of these?

[HEADER 001300D1]
Sure! Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!

[HEADER 001300D2]
It's a clown's nose. I was almost killed by the guy who wore it.

[HEADER 001300D3]
That belongs t' the killer clown you're lookin' for!

[HEADER 001300D4]
That's right.

[HEADER 001300D5]
Can I have it?

[HEADER 001300D6]
Sorry - I'm keeping this as evidence.

[HEADER 001300D7]
You should have told the cops.

[HEADER 001300D8]
I did. They weren't interested.

[HEADER 001300D9]
You should run tests on that, mister.

[HEADER 001300DA]
You could identify the murderer withe a sample of his snot.

[HEADER 001300DB]
Yeuch! I don't think so.

[HEADER 001300DC]
No.

[HEADER 001300DD]
Have you ever seen this man before?

[HEADER 001300DE]
What a slimy character! No - I never seed him.

[HEADER 001300DF]
What do you think this wire could be used for?

[HEADER 001300E0]
Stealin' cars!

[HEADER 001300E1]
There's only one problem...

[HEADER 001300E2]
The local policeman?

[HEADER 001300E3]
No - nobody in Lochmarne has got a car.

[HEADER 001300E4]
Want a closer look at the gem, Maguire?

[HEADER 001300E6]
You'd better hide that, mister.

[HEADER 001300E7]
What if the pixie comes back? You'll be in trouble then!

[HEADER 001300E8]
I don't believe in pixis. Underneath that costume is a psychotic killer.

[HEADER 001300E9]
Smart!

[HEADER 001300E5]
No, I don't. Jewels is for girls.

[HEADER 001300EC]
Ever heard of Thomas Moerlin? Or the Grüber Electronics Corporation?

[HEADER 001300ED]
No.

[HEADER 001300EE]
What do you think this tool is used for?

[HEADER 001300EF]
Liftin' drains.

[HEADER 001300F0]
Dead right! How did you know that?

[HEADER 001300F1]
Work experience course at school.

[HEADER 001300F2]
They gives me a choice o' goin' down the drains or up the chimney.

[HEADER 001300F3]
You're kidding!

[HEADER 001300F8]
I told you - liftin' drains.

[HEADER 001300F9]
Do you recognize this matchbook, Maguire?

[HEADER 001300FA]
No, Sir. I never seed it before in me life.

[HEADER 001300FB]
Do you know what this white powder is?

[HEADER 001300FC]
No.

[HEADER 001300FD]
Give me your hand...

[HEADER 001300FE]
Get lost!

[HEADER 001300FF]
Aw, c'mon. I just want to show you a little trick...

[HEADER 00130100]
No way, mister. I don't do tricks.

[HEADER 00130101]
Father Mahoney told me I'd burn in hell if I did.

[HEADER 00130102]
I just want to shake your hand, that's all.

[HEADER 00130107]
No way!

[HEADER 00130108]
What does this tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 00130109]
Nothin'.

[HEADER 001300C8]
See you later, kid...

[HEADER 001300C9]
Okay, mister.

[HEADER 00140028]
It was a short piece of wire, twisted into a rough circle.

[HEADER 00140029]
As I stared at the circle of wire, the old man snatched it away and put it in his coat.

[HEADER 0014002B]
As soon as the old guy looked away I grabbed his piece of wire.

[HEADER 0014002A]
Almost as if he'd sensed my intentions, the old derelict snatched the wire from the table.

[HEADER 00140353]
Will you leave it alone, man?

[HEADER 00140354]
Look, I know how it seems, but my curiosity got the better of me.

[HEADER 00140356]
Keep your hands to yourself, mister!

[HEADER 00140357]
Hey, I only wanted to...

[HEADER 00140358]
Can't! Hands off!

[HEADER 00140359]
Oh no you don't!

[HEADER 0014035A]
Okay! I'm sorry!

[HEADER 00140352]
Leave it!

[HEADER 00140293]
Hello, there! My name's George Stobbart.

[HEADER 00140295]
Pleased to meet you I'm sure. I'm O'Brien. Can I help you?

[HEADER 00140294]
Excuse me, mister O'Brien...

[HEADER 00140297]
Hello, there. What now?

[HEADER 0014029C]
What can you tell me about the castle, Mr O'Brien?

[HEADER 0014029F]
It's a fine sight now, isn't it?

[HEADER 001402A0]
Dates back to the tenth century, you know.

[HEADER 001402A1]
Most of the existing building was added much later, of course.

[HEADER 001402A2]
Are the ruins open to the public?

[HEADER 001402A3]
Oh, no - it's much too dangerous.

[HEADER 001402A4]
Anyway there's nothing of interest remaining.

[HEADER 001402B3]
How can I get into the castle?

[HEADER 001402B6]
Listen, it's closed, locked, barred and bolted.

[HEADER 001402B7]
The castle is as impenetrable as the walls of Troy.

[HEADER 001402B8]
So I can't get in, then?

[HEADER 001402B9]
My, you're bright for a journalist!

[HEADER 001402B4]
Those walls were built specifically to stop people getting in, Mr Stobbart.

[HEADER 001402B5]
But I dare say you'll find a way, if you've the will...

[HEADER 001402A8]
Can you tell me about the tripod which was found at the castle?

[HEADER 001402A9]
Now there's a bone of contention and controversy.

[HEADER 001402AA]
It was dug up by an Englishman of the archaeological persuasion.

[HEADER 001402AD]
Who was this Englishman?

[HEADER 001402AE]
Professor Peagram. The same man who dug up the gem...

[HEADER 001402D3]
Do you know where I can find Peagram?

[HEADER 001402D4]
You're too late to meet that fella.

[HEADER 001402D5]
Is he dead?

[HEADER 001402D6]
Not that - but he's gone from the village.

[HEADER 001402D7]
A sore point with our esteemed host, I might add!

[HEADER 001402DC]
Do you know where Peagram has gone?

[HEADER 001402DF]
I'm sorry but I don't.

[HEADER 001402E0]
He upped anchor in the dark and shipped out before the dawn.

[HEADER 001402E1]
Why did he do that?

[HEADER 001402E2]
Who knows? A guilty conscience, or a secret assignation...

[HEADER 001402E3]
Whatever the reason he'll not be missed in Lochmarne.

[HEADER 001402E4]
Maybe now the fuss about the gem has died down we can get back to normal.

[HEADER 001402E5]
Why has Peagram's departure upset the landlord?

[HEADER 001402E9]
Well, why don't you ask him yourself, mister Ace-reporter?

[HEADER 001402E6]
He's lost a paying guest, that's why.

[HEADER 001402E7]
More than that - there's the question of an unsettled bill.

[HEADER 001402E8]
Poor Michael's seen red over the business, and I don't blame him.

[HEADER 001402EA]
Can you tell me more about the landlord?

[HEADER 001402EB]
Mick Leary? He's what you call a would-be sophisticate.

[HEADER 001402EC]
The trouble is, his idea of sophistication extends as far as putting paper in the lavatory.

[HEADER 001402ED]
I never worked out why he did dat.. It's much too dark in dere to read.

[HEADER 001402EE]
That's true. Have you ever run your hand over the back of the door?

[HEADER 001402EF]
The graffiti is written in Braille.

[HEADER 001402C1]
What can you tell me about the gem which Peagram found?

[HEADER 001402C2]
Now there is a gem which should never have been taken.

[HEADER 001402C3]
A man would have to be full of greed to covet that stone.

[HEADER 001402C4]
What's your interest in the jewel? You're not a reporter, are you?

[HEADER 001402C5]
Yes, that's right.

[HEADER 001402C6]
Another bloody news hound...! Well, you're wasting your time here, boy.

[HEADER 001402C7]
You'll find the people of Lochmarne are a tight-lipped and cautious lot.

[HEADER 001402C8]
Why? Have you got something to hide?

[HEADER 001402C9]
It's just that we don't like to wash our dirty laundry in public.

[HEADER 001402CA]
Oh, no.

[HEADER 001402CB]
Thank the lord for that.

[HEADER 00140308]
I have a suspicion that Fitzgerald might have been given something by Peagram...

[HEADER 00140309]
I thought he acted strangely!

[HEADER 0014030A]
I'm talking about the gem. It was something he said...

[HEADER 0014030B]
Were you not speaking to him when he ran out of the bar?

[HEADER 0014030C]
I only asked him about the gem...

[HEADER 0014030D]
Fitzgerald has troubles enough already.

[HEADER 0014030E]
He's a nervous, unstable man at the best of times.

[HEADER 0014030F]
The last thing he needs is to be harassed by a hack newsboy!

[HEADER 00140310]
Yeah, sure - just talking, that's all...

[HEADER 001402FB]
Don't you think we should go help Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 00140304]
I don't wish to comment on it - not in front of a hack like you.

[HEADER 00140305]
God knows how you'll twist the tale of the poor lad's mishap!

[HEADER 00140306]
What happened to him? What's he twisted?

[HEADER 00140307]
Hush, Pat! This devil will steal the words out of your gob while they're still steaming!

[HEADER 001402FC]
If he's been hit by a car, he could be injured...

[HEADER 001402FD]
It's high time there was stiffer legislation against careless motorists.

[HEADER 001402FE]
What we need is a by-pass around d' village.

[HEADER 001402FF]
One o' dem ring roads - like d' M-twenty-five!

[HEADER 001402F1]
Do you know Sean Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 001402F9]
I'm not telling you anything, mister.

[HEADER 001402FA]
You can dig up your own dirt!

[HEADER 001402F2]
Yes, I do.

[HEADER 001402F3]
What do you want with him?

[HEADER 001402F4]
I want to talk to him about working at the dig.

[HEADER 001402F5]
What makes you think he did?

[HEADER 001402F6]
The boy outside told me.

[HEADER 001402F7]
I can't imagine anyone employing Sean Fitzgerald on a dig.

[HEADER 001402F8]
He wouldn't know a post hole from his elbow!

[HEADER 001402BA]
Have you heard of the Phantom?

[HEADER 001402BB]
More than that - I've seen it!

[HEADER 001402BC]
And let me tell you - it's a dreadful spectacle!

[HEADER 001402BD]
So it's not just a local legend?

[HEADER 001402BE]
There really IS a Phantom of Lochmarne?

[HEADER 001402BF]
Oh, no.

[HEADER 001402C0]
I was talking about the Phantom of the Opera.

[HEADER 00140312]
Have you ever heard of the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 00140313]
I most certainly have! A remarkable institution.

[HEADER 00140315]
Did you know they were the originators of our system of credit?

[HEADER 00140316]
Their financial empire stretched from the Atlantic to the Caspian Sea.

[HEADER 00140317]
With bases in so many countries they had to establish new methods of fiscal transferral.

[HEADER 00140318]
So the Knights Templar were nothing but a bunch of bankers!

[HEADER 00140319]
I don't get it. Are you sayin' dese Templar guys invented bank charges?

[HEADER 0014031A]
In a manner of speaking, I suppose they did.

[HEADER 0014031B]
What a dirty trick! Didn't anyone try to stop dem?

[HEADER 0014031C]
Oh, yes. They were arrested, and many were burnt at the stake!

[HEADER 0014031D]
Good! Dey bloody well deserved it if dey were anythin' like MY bank manager!

[HEADER 00140321]
Does this towel mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00140322]
Sure - it's one of Leary's towels. Are you planning on stealing it?

[HEADER 00140323]
Just borrowing it, if you must know.

[HEADER 00140324]
Did I show you this towel?

[HEADER 00140325]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 00140326]
Does this red nose suggest anything to you?

[HEADER 0014032B]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 0014032C]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 0014032D]
No. I've never seen him before.

[HEADER 0014032E]
What do you make of this piece of wire?

[HEADER 0014032F]
It looks ordinary enough to me...

[HEADER 00140330]
Do you recognize this gem?

[HEADER 00140331]
Ah, that's a beautiful stone. Is it the one which Peagram found?

[HEADER 00140332]
Yeah - and the reason why both he and Fitzgerald have disappeared.

[HEADER 00140333]
Then it's only a matter of time before you vanish too.

[HEADER 00140334]
Yes, you've already shown me that.

[HEADER 00140335]
What can you tell me about this ID pass?

[HEADER 00140336]
Grüber Electronics? I've never heard of it.

[HEADER 00140337]
Does this tool mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00140338]
I'd say it was for lifting manhole covers.

[HEADER 0014033C]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0014033D]
The design is Middle Eastern, I'd say.

[HEADER 0014033E]
What do you make of this white powder?

[HEADER 0014033F]
Could it be bicarborunderate of soda?

[HEADER 00140340]
I'd like to shake you by the hand, Mr O'Brien...

[HEADER 00140344]
Oh, no, you don't!

[HEADER 00140345]
What do you make of this tissue?

[HEADER 00140347]
I'd guess that muck on it is greasepaint.

[HEADER 0014034B]
What do you think of this flashlight?

[HEADER 0014034C]
It's not a very practical piece of equipment, is it?

[HEADER 0014034D]
It's not switched on.

[HEADER 0014034E]
I'm referring to the lack of a bracket.

[HEADER 0014034F]
How would you be fixing that to your bicycle?

[HEADER 00140350]
I don't have a bicycle.

[HEADER 00140351]
I've told you already.

[HEADER 0014031F]
Goodbye for now...

[HEADER 00140320]
Good riddance to you!

[HEADER 00140000]
There was a vacant look on his cow-like face that said quite clearly 'Nobody Home'.

[HEADER 0014002D]
Hi! My name's Stobbart - George Stobbart.

[HEADER 0014002F]
Hello dere, mister. What can I do for you?

[HEADER 0014002E]
Hey!

[HEADER 00140030]
Hello dere again, mister.

[HEADER 0014003D]
Can you tell me anything about the castle on the hill?

[HEADER 0014003E]
Oh, I don't know much about anyting!

[HEADER 0014003F]
You should ask Mr. O'Brien here - he does joined-up writing.

[HEADER 00140040]
Would you be one o' dem history fellas yourself?

[HEADER 00140041]
That's right! Professor Stobbart, Miskatonic University.

[HEADER 00140042]
You're an archaeologist? And you're asking us about the castle?

[HEADER 00140043]
Excuse me, Mister O'Brien! D' gentleman was talkin' t' me!

[HEADER 00140049]
How come you didn't leave with d' others?

[HEADER 0014004B]
I didn't know they'd gone!

[HEADER 0014004C]
Oh, yes. Packed dere spades and shovels and away dey went.

[HEADER 0014004D]
Seems I missed all the excitement!

[HEADER 0014004E]
What excitement?

[HEADER 00140052]
Oh, no. I'm here on vacation.

[HEADER 00140053]
What's dat?

[HEADER 00140054]
A vacation, Pat. It's what the Americans call a holiday.

[HEADER 00140055]
But he's lying to you, anyhow. He told me he's a journalist.

[HEADER 00140056]
Oh. What's wrong wid dat?

[HEADER 00140057]
Journalists are mostly scum, Pat.

[HEADER 00140058]
What? Even Clark Kent? I can't believe it!

[HEADER 00140059]
Oh, right. In Lochmarne? You come to Lochmarne for a holiday?

[HEADER 0014005A]
Sure. It's a very pretty place.

[HEADER 0014005B]
Where d' hell are you from, mister?

[HEADER 0014005C]
California.

[HEADER 0014005D]
I know it! Dat's where da prunes come from!

[HEADER 0014005E]
Ha-ha. Yeah... amongst other things.

[HEADER 0014005F]
Do you know Professor Peagram?

[HEADER 00140060]
Do I know him? Do I know d' good Professor himself?

[HEADER 00140061]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 00140062]
I mean, I know who he is, but I don't know him to talk to.

[HEADER 00140068]
Do you know anything about Peagram's excavation?

[HEADER 00140069]
Only dat he didn't have d' right tools for d' job.

[HEADER 0014006A]
What he needed was shovels and a J.C.B.!

[HEADER 0014006B]
Peagram was digging for historical remains, not coal.

[HEADER 0014006C]
Is dat a fact? What d' hell for?

[HEADER 0014006D]
It's the science of archaeology, Pat.

[HEADER 0014006E]
Understanding how people used to live by what they've left behind.

[HEADER 0014006F]
One day archaeologists might be digging up OUR remains.

[HEADER 00140070]
Imagine dat, Mister O'Brien! I wonder what dey'll find?

[HEADER 00140071]
Well, it won't be arrow-heads and beakers.

[HEADER 00140072]
Fast food cartons and flavored condoms, more likely.

[HEADER 00140073]
Did anyone from the village work at Peagram's dig?

[HEADER 00140074]
I tried it meself, but dat high-an'-mighty history man called me incontinent!

[HEADER 00140075]
What a nerve! Hadn't I dug more holes dan d' rest o' dem put togedder?

[HEADER 0014007E]
Aren't you going to help Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 0014007F]
What does he need my help for?

[HEADER 00140080]
Didn't you hear what Maguire said? He's been hit by a car!

[HEADER 00140081]
What an idiot! People call me stupid, but I've never done that.

[HEADER 00140082]
Don't you feel any sympathy for poor Fitzgerald?

[HEADER 00140083]
He never bothered about me, so why should I?

[HEADER 00140076]
Do you remember seeing Sean Fitzgerald at the dig?

[HEADER 00140077]
Hmm... Let me see, now...

[HEADER 00140078]
I think me brainbox needs a spot o'lubrication.

[HEADER 00140079]
Do you remember Sean Fitzgerald now?

[HEADER 0014007A]
I can picture d' scene as if it was only last week.

[HEADER 0014007B]
Come to think of it, it WAS only last week.

[HEADER 0014007C]
Fitzgerald was dere all right, him an' a bunch o' students.

[HEADER 0014007D]
He was speakin' wid the boss man.

[HEADER 00140036]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HEADER 00140037]
You most certainly can!

[HEADER 00140038]
Give me a drink for my friend here.

[HEADER 00140039]
Who? Doyle? Has he conned you into buying for him?

[HEADER 0014003A]
Shame on you, Patrick! Same again?

[HEADER 0014003B]
Just a pint this time, Michael.

[HEADER 0014003C]
One pint o' brown, comin' up!

[HEADER 001400B0]
What do you think of this towel?

[HEADER 001400B1]
Now there's a fine piece of cloth if ever I did see one!

[HEADER 001400B2]
Such craft must surely come from linen cupboards of the Vatican itself!

[HEADER 001400B5]
Look at this towel...

[HEADER 001400B6]
You showed me that before.

[HEADER 001400B7]
What does this false nose mean to you?

[HEADER 001400B8]
Ah, now - you're a clown.

[HEADER 001400C8]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 001400C9]
It's a handsome mug on that fella, to be sure. Is he a film star?

[HEADER 001400D1]
Do you recognize this gem?

[HEADER 001400D2]
Saints be praised! It must be worth a fortune!

[HEADER 001400D9]
Does this security pass mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001400DA]
Uh... hmmm. Well... no.

[HEADER 001400DB]
What do you make of this tool?

[HEADER 001400DC]
It's for lifting manhole covers.

[HEADER 001400DF]
Do you recognize this matchbook?

[HEADER 001400E0]
No.

[HEADER 001400E1]
Do you recognise this white powder?

[HEADER 001400E2]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 001400E3]
May I shake your hand...?

[HEADER 001400E4]
No, you can't.

[HEADER 001400E5]
How come?

[HEADER 001400E6]
Because I'll spill my beer if you do.

[HEADER 001400E7]
Does this tissue mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001400EC]
No, boss.

[HEADER 001400ED]
What do you think of this flashlight?

[HEADER 001400EE]
It's not very bright, is it?

[HEADER 001400EF]
I could say the same about some of the present company...

[HEADER 001400F0]
That's true. But don't let him hear you.

[HEADER 001400F1]
Keep it under your hat, mister.

[HEADER 001400F2]
That flashlight, like your brain Doyle, is not switched on.

[HEADER 001400F4]
You showed me before, mister.

[HEADER 001400CF]
Does this piece of wire mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001400D0]
Not me, mister.

[HEADER 001400AF]
'Bye for now...

[HEADER 00160000]
The farmer's craggy face was set in a mask of aesthetic appreciation.

[HEADER 00160001]
His feet were set in a pair of manure-caked boots.

[HEADER 0016000D]
Hi!

[HEADER 0016000E]
Do you speak English?

[HEADER 0016000F]
Well now - what if I was to say no?

[HEADER 00160010]
An implication of cognizance shrouded in denial - a pretty poser of a paradox indeed.

[HEADER 00160011]
I gave him the look I'd perfected when I was twelve and was going to be the greatest hypnotist of all time.

[HEADER 00160012]
It was a killer.

[HEADER 00160013]
Are you attempting to hypnotize me or is it the constipation you're suffering?

[HEADER 00160014]
I was a little out of practice...

[HEADER 00160015]
It's me again...

[HEADER 00160016]
So I see. What now?

[HEADER 00160025]
What can you tell me about the castle?

[HEADER 00160026]
Not much, I'm sorry to say. Most of its history is long forgotten.

[HEADER 00160027]
Ah, but if these old stones could only speak, what stories they'd tell...

[HEADER 00160028]
Stories to make your toes curl and your blood run cold!

[HEADER 00160029]
You know, this castle is said to be over six hundred years old!

[HEADER 00160033]
Did you happen to see a red sports car down on the road?

[HEADER 00160034]
I caught a glimpse of a flash of red on the hill and heard the racket!

[HEADER 00160035]
Sure it was an awful noise. A sports car, you say?

[HEADER 00160036]
A Ferrari, to be exact.

[HEADER 00160037]
A racing car? And what was it doing here?

[HEADER 00160038]
The poor fella must have been lost!

[HEADER 00160039]
The driver of the Ferrari was involved in an accident.

[HEADER 0016003A]
Is that so?

[HEADER 0016003B]
Yeah - he knocked somebody down outside the bar.

[HEADER 0016003C]
What an idiot! How could a thing like that happen?

[HEADER 0016003D]
He was travelling too fast.

[HEADER 0016003E]
So fast he ran right under the car?

[HEADER 0016003F]
I mean the car was travelling too fast.

[HEADER 00160040]
But you'd have thought the idiot could have heard it coming!

[HEADER 00160048]
Maybe you know the guy who was hit by the Ferrari?

[HEADER 00160049]
His name is Sean Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 0016004A]
Oh, I know him all right.

[HEADER 0016004B]
That's my nephew - the idiot responsible for the stacking of my hay cart.

[HEADER 0016004C]
Was he killed by the car?

[HEADER 0016004D]
Oh, no. But he has been abducted.

[HEADER 0016004E]
Well, that's a relief now.

[HEADER 0016004F]
Aren't you going to look for your nephew?

[HEADER 00160050]
What for? From what you say, it's too late.

[HEADER 00160051]
You could report the matter to the police.

[HEADER 00160052]
Better not. Besides, what could they do?

[HEADER 00160053]
Well, they could mount a search!

[HEADER 00160054]
They have only the one bicycle between them.

[HEADER 00160055]
In a question of superior acceleration, I'd put my money on the Ferrari...

[HEADER 00160056]
I think you ought to know exactly what Sean has gotten himself into...

[HEADER 00160057]
I'm not sure I want to know!

[HEADER 00160058]
But you're his uncle, his own flesh and blood!

[HEADER 00160059]
You're right, but what can I do?

[HEADER 0016005A]
If I'm not here to guard it, some idiot might try to climb the hay stack!

[HEADER 0016005B]
What a moral dilemma!

[HEADER 0016005C]
To stay here and guard this potentially lethal agricultural construction...

[HEADER 0016005D]
Or to go off in search of the prodigal nephew, the very man responsible for said hazard?

[HEADER 0016005E]
It'll need some thinkin' about.

[HEADER 0016005F]
Why, there's no problem.

[HEADER 00160060]
You're right. Why didn't I think of it before?

[HEADER 00160061]
We'll demolish the haystack.

[HEADER 00160062]
You don't have to demolish the haystack to go look for Sean.

[HEADER 00160063]
I'll stay here in your place and warn anyone who's silly enough to climb it...

[HEADER 00160064]
Marvelous! I think I should start my enquiries in the bar...

[HEADER 00160065]
He strode off in the direction of MacDevitts bar, leaving me to contemplate the stack of hay.

[HEADER 0016006A]
Have you seen Professor Peagram?

[HEADER 0016006B]
No. He's packed up and gone.

[HEADER 0016006C]
Do you happen to know where?

[HEADER 0016006D]
Back in England, I suppose.

[HEADER 00160080]
Have you any use for this towel?

[HEADER 00160081]
Whatever gave you that idea? Oh dear, oh dear me, no.

[HEADER 00160082]
Does this curiously twisted piece of wire mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00160083]
Oh dear. Now what would you be wanting with a cruel snare like that?

[HEADER 00160084]
It's not mine! It belongs to the old guy in the bar...

[HEADER 00160085]
Ah, yes - it would.

[HEADER 00160086]
Is this wire intended to be used as a snare?

[HEADER 00160087]
That's right.

[HEADER 00160088]
This is the gem that Peagram found in the castle...

[HEADER 00160089]
So that's what all the fuss was about...

[HEADER 0016008A]
I can't see why, myself. Why men would fight and steal and kill over a little bauble like that.

[HEADER 0016008B]
It's kinda neat the way it sparkles...

[HEADER 0016008C]
And that's where it belongs!

[HEADER 0016008D]
Does this false nose mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0016008E]
You're a circus clown.

[HEADER 00160094]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00160095]
No, but I wouldn't trust him. His eyes are too close together.

[HEADER 0016009A]
Do you recognize the name on this card?

[HEADER 0016009B]
I can't read that little writing!

[HEADER 001600A5]
Does this tool mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001600A6]
No, it doesn't. Is it used on sheep?

[HEADER 001600A7]
No, its for lifting the covers off drains.

[HEADER 001600A8]
Never! How?

[HEADER 001600A9]
The end of the tool fits into a hole in the cover...

[HEADER 001600AA]
They'd slip out. Angle's all wrong... You'd never do it.

[HEADER 001600AB]
I have! I did it in Paris.

[HEADER 001600AC]
You already showed me that, and I wasn't impressed.

[HEADER 001600AD]
What do you make of this matchbook?

[HEADER 001600AE]
Seems ordinary enough to me.

[HEADER 001600AF]
What do you make of this tissue?

[HEADER 001600B0]
That's a sorry sight to wave about in public!

[HEADER 001600B6]
Would you like to shake my hand?

[HEADER 001600B7]
What is this? I don't do that male bonding stuff!

[HEADER 001600BF]
What do you think of my flashlight?

[HEADER 001600C0]
Those electric lamps are useful, but limited in lifespan, in my experience.

[HEADER 001600C1]
I was given one for my birthday, but it stopped working after a month.

[HEADER 001600C2]
The battery was probably drained.

[HEADER 001600C3]
What? Nobody told me! I threw it away!

[HEADER 001600C4]
Did I show you my flashlight?

[HEADER 001600C5]
Indeed you did.

[HEADER 0016007F]
I have to go now.

[HEADER 00140007]
The white whiskers on the bartender's flushed face were like garlands on a Christmas tree.

[HEADER 00140008]
The resemblance ended there. The top of his head was too slick and shiny to act as a perch for a Christmas fairy.

[HEADER 00140178]
Top of the morning to you!

[HEADER 0014017A]
I beg your pardon?

[HEADER 0014017B]
That's what you Irish say, isn't it?

[HEADER 0014017C]
Do you want something or are you just flaunting your xenophobia?

[HEADER 0014017D]
Unh... I was trying to be sociable.

[HEADER 0014017E]
Hmph! Is it a room you're after?

[HEADER 00140181]
That's not a bad idea. Do you have a vacancy?

[HEADER 00140182]
I could, if you don't mind waiting until the last guest checks out.

[HEADER 00140183]
No problem. When will that be?

[HEADER 00140184]
When the undertaker comes to collect him.

[HEADER 0014017F]
No, thank you. I don't plan to stay too long.

[HEADER 00140180]
Who does? Most folk take one look at Lochmarne and jump back on the bus.

[HEADER 00140179]
Excuse me!

[HEADER 00140191]
Yes, Sir?

[HEADER 0014019F]
I'll try a glass of beer, please.

[HEADER 001401A0]
Is this your first pint of 'real ale'?

[HEADER 001401A1]
Uh, well... I guess so! What's 'real ale', anyhow?

[HEADER 001401A2]
Beer that's brewed from natural ingredients to traditional methods.

[HEADER 001401A3]
It shouldn't be kept under pressure, or refrigerated.

[HEADER 001401A4]
And finally, it should have a good body and distinctive character.

[HEADER 001401A5]
In other words, it's flat and warm with bits in and it makes you fall over.

[HEADER 001401A6]
May I have another beer, please?

[HEADER 001401A7]
Certainly, Sir! Same again?

[HEADER 001401A8]
Yeah, please. How is this stuff made?

[HEADER 001401A9]
That's the secret of the master brewers, Sir!

[HEADER 001401AA]
Each barrel is lovingly manhandled in time-honoured fashion...

[HEADER 001401AB]
Suspended on skilfully tied ropes of the finest hemp...

[HEADER 001401AC]
Lowered into the cellar utilising the forces of original gravity.

[HEADER 001401AD]
Like manna from heaven!

[HEADER 001401AE]
Hey, how about another drink!

[HEADER 001401AF]
Same again?

[HEADER 001401B0]
Hmm,,, Do you serve cocktails?

[HEADER 001401B1]
I'll serve anyone with manners and money.

[HEADER 001401B2]
I'm serious. Have you considered turning MacDevitts into a cocktail bar?

[HEADER 001401B3]
Cocktails are chic, cool, and popular with younger drinkers!

[HEADER 001401B4]
What? Kids in the bar?! Can you imagine it?

[HEADER 001401B5]
Pinball, pimples and puke!

[HEADER 001401B6]
Er right - I get the picture. I'll settle for a glass of stout.

[HEADER 001401B7]
Gimme another beer, dude!

[HEADER 001401B8]
Give EVERYONE another beer! Let's PARTY, guys!

[HEADER 001401B9]
I think you've had enough, don't you?

[HEADER 001401BA]
Hey, listen - is it supposed to taste the way it does?

[HEADER 001401BB]
Gopaleen's stout is brewed from the finest chemicals in the world!

[HEADER 001401BC]
More beer, over here!

[HEADER 001401BE]
I'm sorry, but the pump appears to be broken!

[HEADER 001401BF]
I could fix it for you!

[HEADER 001401C0]
I don't think so. This is a job for a professional electrician.

[HEADER 001401C1]
Oh well, at least the glass washer is still working...

[HEADER 001401C2]
It's not my day, is it?

[HEADER 001401D3]
Have you served any, uh... clowns recently?

[HEADER 001401D4]
No, you're the first today.

[HEADER 001401F2]
Do you know a man called Peagram?

[HEADER 001401F3]
Indeed I do!

[HEADER 001401F4]
Are you a friend of his, by any chance?

[HEADER 001401FC]
Oh, no. I'm just trying to track him down.

[HEADER 001401FD]
Me too! That son of a bitch should be locked away!

[HEADER 001401FE]
Did Peagram stay here?

[HEADER 001401FF]
Yes, he did! Six nights - plus breakfast.

[HEADER 0014026F]
It just so happens I'm an electrician! Check out my credentials..

[HEADER 00140270]
Well, now, isn't that marvelous?

[HEADER 00140271]
Here's a house bedevilled with faulty wiring of a wayward nature...

[HEADER 00140272]
Here's you, an electric man - with a little plastic card t' prove it!

[HEADER 00140273]
Hmm... I still want to see what you can do before I let you touch my beer pumps...

[HEADER 00140274]
You can make a start on the glass washer.

[HEADER 00140275]
When you've finished that will you take a look at the pumps...?

[HEADER 00140276]
Check out my card...

[HEADER 00140277]
I've seen it, for heaven's sake!

[HEADER 0014026A]
Do you recognize the name on this card?

[HEADER 0014026B]
No - should I?

[HEADER 0014026C]
Nah. It was a long shot.

[HEADER 0014022F]
I found your flashlight.

[HEADER 00140230]
So I see. You'd better keep hold of that until you've fixed the pumps.

[HEADER 00140231]
Do you recognize this man?

[HEADER 00140232]
No, I don't. What d'you want with him?

[HEADER 00140233]
I've got a score to settle...

[HEADER 00140234]
I don't want any trouble in the bar, mister.

[HEADER 00140235]
If it's a fight you're looking for, see Father Mahoney.

[HEADER 00140236]
A priest? A man of the cloth?

[HEADER 00140237]
Sure, and he teaches the boys how to box at the youth club.

[HEADER 00140238]
According to Mahoney, it develops character.

[HEADER 00140239]
Isn't that right, Pat? Didn't he teach you the art of pugilism?

[HEADER 0014023A]
Doyle!

[HEADER 0014023B]
Sorry, Michael. I was miles away. What did you say?

[HEADER 0014023C]
Ah, never mind.

[HEADER 0014023D]
You already asked me that.

[HEADER 0014023E]
Does this false nose mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00140246]
No, it doesn't!

[HEADER 00140247]
Does this piece of wire mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0014024C]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 0014024D]
Here's something which might interest you...

[HEADER 00140257]
It doesn't.

[HEADER 00140258]
Do you recognize this matchbook?

[HEADER 00140259]
No, Sir.

[HEADER 0014025A]
Does this...

[HEADER 0014025F]
I'm not interested.

[HEADER 00140261]
Hey, bartender!

[HEADER 00140262]
Landlord, if y' don't mind.

[HEADER 00140263]
Sorry. Shake my hand, why don't you...

[HEADER 00140264]
Now why should I do that? What have you got up your sleeve?

[HEADER 00140265]
Nothing! C'mon, just shake my hand...

[HEADER 00140266]
Not just now, mister. I have t' be careful on account o' the health restrictions.

[HEADER 00140267]
Aw, jeez!

[HEADER 00140268]
Why won't you shake my hand?

[HEADER 00140269]
Because I don't know where you've been.

[HEADER 00140278]
May I borrow this towel?

[HEADER 00140279]
Sure you can, on one condition...

[HEADER 0014027A]
What's that?

You keep it away from old Ron.

[HEADER 0014027C]
Who's Ron?

[HEADER 0014027D]
That's him in the corner - with the hygiene problem.

[HEADER 0014027E]
You can keep it.

[HEADER 0014027F]
Does this gem mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00140280]
Phew! What a beauty! I bet you wish that was real, don't you?

[HEADER 00140281]
Does this tissue mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00140282]
That's disgusting!

[HEADER 00140283]
Uh-huh! I found it in the sewers

[HEADER 00140284]
What's the idea of waving it around in my face?

[HEADER 00140285]
You're worse than old Ron! Put it away, man!

[HEADER 00140286]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 0014022B]
Look, I gotta be going...

[HEADER 0014001D]
It was an electrical plug attached to the glass washer.

[HEADER 00140021]
I replaced the fuse with the piece of wire.

[HEADER 00140022]
I knew it was dangerous, but I was desperate enough to disregard everything I knew about standard safety precautions.

[HEADER 0014015A]
Excuse me, Mr Leary!

[HEADER 0014015B]
I fixed your glass washer, no problem.

[HEADER 0014015C]
Bingo, and a blessing to all the saints!

[HEADER 0014015D]
A free half pint to that man, on the house!

[HEADER 0014015E]
Now - could you take a look at the beer pumps?

[HEADER 0014015F]
I guess so, but I'm not making any promises...

[HEADER 00140160]
If you can't fix them I'll have a riot on my hands!

[HEADER 00140161]
The pumps are in the cellar, right?

[HEADER 00140162]
That's right. You'll find a flashlight down there somewhere...

[HEADER 00140020]
I looked at the plug I'd fixed and felt a glow of pride. All my own work!

[HEADER 0014001E]
I used all my knowledge of electrical engineering to examine the plug.

[HEADER 0015000E]
It was the lever which locked the trapdoor.

[HEADER 0015000F]
I pushed the lever and heard the grating of metal, but nothing appeared to happen...

[HEADER 00150010]
I pulled the lever and the bolt creaked back into place.

[HEADER 00130015]
It was a trapdoor in the sidewalk.

[HEADER 00130016]
The trapdoor gave access to the cellar of the bar.

[HEADER 00130018]
I lifted the trapdoor and an overpowering smell of stale beer rose from the cellar below.

[HEADER 0013010A]
I looked down on a stone tiled floor - way too far to jump.

[HEADER 0013010B]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 0013010C]
There was an nasty feeling in my guts I usually associated with light opera.

[HEADER 0013010D]
It was Khan.

[HEADER 0013010E]
What's the problem?

[HEADER 0013010F]
Did you see what happened here a few minutes ago?

[HEADER 00130110]
What was that?

[HEADER 00130111]
A man was involved in an unfortunate accident.

[HEADER 00130112]
I didn't see anything.

[HEADER 00130113]
What about the boy?

[HEADER 00130114]
He doesn't know anything, either.

[HEADER 00130115]
The kid... well - you know how it is in these rural communities.

[HEADER 00130116]
Not enough genes to go round...

[HEADER 00130117]
I prayed Maguire had the sense to keep his mouth shut.

[HEADER 00130118]
Was the guy hurt bad?

[HEADER 00130119]
He's been taken care of, but he thinks he dropped a small parcel.

[HEADER 0013011A]
You didn't happen to find it, did you?

[HEADER 0013011B]
If I had, I would have taken it to the police.

[HEADER 0013011C]
Of course.

[HEADER 0013011D]
Thank you.

[HEADER 00130019]
It wasn't nerves that stopped me jumping; it was my damned legs. They wouldn't move.

[HEADER 00130017]
I tugged at the trapdoor, but it was locked from the inside.

[HEADER 00160007]
On the back of the cart was a crazily stacked tower of hay bales, leaning precariously against the castle wall.

[HEADER 00170000]
The stack of hay stopped short of the top of the wall.

[HEADER 00170001]
Even if I stretched as far as I could, the wall was out of reach.

[HEADER 00170002]
What I needed was a slice or two of Alice's Wonderland...

[HEADER 00170004]
The lifting key was rammed tightly into the crack in the wall forming a strong foothold.

[HEADER 00170003]
There was a narrow crack between two of the stones where the centuries-old mortar had crumbled away.

[HEADER 00170007]
I inserted the end of the lifting key in the mortarless crack and gave it a firm shove.

[HEADER 00170008]
It remained lodged in the wall, jutting out to form a step.

[HEADER 00170006]
I tugged at the lifting key and found they were held quite securely.

[HEADER 00170005]
I pushed my fingers into the narrow crack. It went back several inches into the rock.

[HEADER 00170009]
Above my head was a gap in the wall where the massive stones had fallen away.

[HEADER 00150002]
Now I could see, I spotted Mr Leary's flashlight easily.

[HEADER 00150003]
Then I noticed a flash of light, something sparkling beneath the open trapdoor...

[HEADER 00150004]
It was Peagram's gem all right: a large, uncut, blue stone.

[HEADER 00150006]
I guess I was already under its spell.

[HEADER 0015001A]
Did you find it?

[HEADER 0015001B]
What?

[HEADER 0015001C]
Whatever you was lookin' for.

[HEADER 0015001D]
Uh... yeah. Listen, Maguire - I want you to keep this to yourself.

[HEADER 0015001E]
No problemo. Jus' chuck us up a crate o' lager.

[HEADER 0015001F]
No way. You're not old enough.

[HEADER 00150020]
We can sell it an' make some cash!

[HEADER 00150021]
Forget it, kid. I couldn't  betray Mr Leary's trust.

[HEADER 00150022]
I could, for sure! That ol' misery-guts deserves it!

[HEADER 00150023]
If you want to do me a favor, keep a look out for that guy in the suit...

[HEADER 00150024]
Okay, but it'll cost you a packet o' chips!

[HEADER 00150025]
...and shout if you see that Ferrari!

[HEADER 00150007]
It was a rusty faucet.

[HEADER 0015000C]
The slow drip of water barely dampened the towel.

[HEADER 0015000A]
I held the towel under the faucet and soaked it with water.

[HEADER 00150008]
The faucet creaked, coughed and spewed out a stream of rusty colored water.

[HEADER 00150009]
I shut off the faucet as tight as I could, but it kept on dripping.

[HEADER 00180004]
It was a rusted piece of iron, maybe part of a plough or something.

[HEADER 00180005]
The rope by which the goat was tethered had become tangled on the old plough share...

[HEADER 00190000]
Behind the altar was a carved panel, decorated with animals, birds and plants.

[HEADER 00190002]
I tried in vain to move the panel...

[HEADER 00190014]
The sack contained a fine white powder.

[HEADER 00190016]
As I dipped my fingers into the soft white powder I realized what it was.

[HEADER 00190017]
Plaster of Paris! I'd used it in kindergarten to make casts of animal paw prints.

[HEADER 00190018]
I reached into the sack, but it was empty.

[HEADER 0019000D]
The statue was too heavy to lift. It overbalanced into the sand...

[HEADER 0019000E]
As I swung the stone upright I noticed it had left a pattern of holes in the sand...

[HEADER 0019000F]
I swung the stone back to its original position.

[HEADER 0019001C]
The patch of sand where the statue had fallen was covered with a dense sprinkling of plaster.

[HEADER 0019001D]
My improvised plaster cast was slowly drying out...

[HEADER 0019001B]
The five fingers on the back of the statue had left their impressions in the fine sand.

[HEADER 0019000A]
It was a statue which had fallen from its place on the wall.

[HEADER 00190022]
I sprinkled the plaster on the sand until the holes were filled.

[HEADER 00190025]
The trickle of water was quickly absorbed by the plaster.

[HEADER 00190024]
I squeezed every last drop of water out of the towel and watched it draining away in the sand.

[HEADER 00190027]
I squeezed the towel as hard as I could, but it was barely damp.

[HEADER 00190020]
I smoothed the plaster level with the sand. It was my first experience of home improvement...

[HEADER 00190012]
I eased the solid piece of plaster from the sand.

[HEADER 00190013]
Underneath, it had formed a perfect copy of the statue.

[HEADER 0019001F]
I placed my fingers in the five impressions left by the fallen stone. It was weird - they fit perfectly...

[HEADER 00190003]
There was a pattern of five holes arranged on the wall. They'd been drilled there deliberately.

[HEADER 00190005]
The hardened plaster cast fitted snugly into the five matching sockets. There was a soft thud, then silence...

[HEADER 00190006]
I placed my fingers and thumb into the holes in the wall. Nothing happened.

[HEADER 00140163]
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

[HEADER 00140164]
Excuse me?

[HEADER 00140165]
No customers behind the bar! Ever!

[HEADER 00140166]
Get out!

[HEADER 00140167]
I could try to fix your glass washer.

[HEADER 00140168]
Oh, no - not unless you're a qualified electrician...

[HEADER 00140003]
The farmer was drinking and chatting with his pals as if nothing had happened.

[HEADER 001400F5]
Hello!

[HEADER 001400F7]
Ah, hello there. Let me introduce you to my pals...

[HEADER 001400F8]
We've already met.

[HEADER 001400F9]
What now?

[HEADER 001400FA]
I want you to know you have my sympathy...

[HEADER 001400FB]
Oh, it's just terrible! Awful!

[HEADER 001400FC]
It's the worst news I heard all day.

[HEADER 001400FD]
It's topped the bad news all right, for this week and the next.

[HEADER 001400FE]
The whole year...

[HEADER 001400FF]
It's worse than that - it's the worst disaster in living memory!

[HEADER 00140100]
Isn't it the biggest calamity in the history of the village?

[HEADER 00140101]
I would say it's the biggest in the history of Ireland!

[HEADER 00140102]
The most awesome disaster since mankind paddled out of the primal plop...

[HEADER 00140103]
There's no beer.

[HEADER 00140105]
What about Sean? Why aren't you out looking for him?

[HEADER 00140106]
There's no point in launching an ill-equipped expedition to save the lad.

[HEADER 00140107]
In a life or death situation, preparation is essential.

[HEADER 00140108]
That's why I slipped in here.

[HEADER 00140109]
For a pint.

[HEADER 0014010A]
Is a glass of beer more important than a man's life!?

[HEADER 0014010B]
Were you talking to me?

[HEADER 0014010C]
To all of you! Sean Fitzgerald has met with God-knows-what, and all you can do is drink!

[HEADER 0014010D]
Sean has gone for a ride in a flash car, that's all.

[HEADER 0014010E]
Why don't you calm down and join us?

[HEADER 00140112]
Do you have any use for this towel?

[HEADER 00140113]
I suppose I could squeeze it out into my glass if I was desperate enough...

[HEADER 00140110]
Do you know anything about this piece of wire?

[HEADER 00140111]
It looks like a hand made snare.

[HEADER 00140127]
So that's what all the fuss was about...

[HEADER 00140128]
I can't see why, myself. Why men would fight and steal and kill over a little bauble like that.

[HEADER 00140129]
Well, it's kinda neat the way it sparkles...

[HEADER 00140115]
You're a circus clown.

[HEADER 00140017]
It was an electric glass washer. It looked even older than the barman.

[HEADER 00140018]
I couldn't see anything obviously wrong with the machine. I figured it must be the wiring.

[HEADER 00160002]
The gates were made of solid, age-blackened wood.

[HEADER 00160004]
Pushing with all my strength got me nowhere. They didn't budge. I really need to start working out.

[HEADER 0013001D]
I was tellin' the truth about Fitzy, Mister!

[HEADER 0013001E]
Okay, okay - calm down. Now, tell me what happened...

[HEADER 0013001F]
I was standin' here, mindin' me own business,

[HEADER 00130020]
...when I saw this beautiful red sports car comin' up over the hill.

[HEADER 00130021]
Wouldja look at dat, says I, an' I goin' over to take a closer look.

[HEADER 00130022]
Next ting Fitzy comes tearin' out of the pub an' nearly knocks me on me arse!

[HEADER 00130023]
He was like a chicken without a head - he hadn't a clue where he was goin'.

[HEADER 00130024]
Anyhow, he tears out in the road. Well, the car just flies at him.

[HEADER 00130025]
It was too fast for poor ol' Fitzy, an' hit him an awful wallop...

[HEADER 00130026]
He goes flyin' up on top.

[HEADER 00130027]
Jaysus, says I - I thought he was a goner.

[HEADER 00130028]
Next thing the driver hops out and I couldn't believe my eyes...

[HEADER 00130029]
He was dressed like a bloody pixie!

[HEADER 00001E33]
I passed the castle on the way into Lochmarne.

[HEADER 00001E34]
The castle where Peagram's excavation was located.

[HEADER 0019000B]
Five fingers of stone projected from the back of the carving.

[HEADER 0019000C]
The statue lay face up in the soft sand.

[HEADER 00190026]
The trickle of water splashed onto the hardened plaster.
