[HEADER 00004A38]
The guard in the basement won't let me into the excavation.

[HEADER 00004A42]
You need his keys. The washroom door is also locked.

[HEADER 00004A4C]
Ask the guard if you can get his keys. Now what if the key to the excavation was on the same ring as the key to the washroom?

[HEADER 00004A56]
I have the guard's keys, but he won't let me past.

[HEADER 00004A60]
You need to get hold of that site entrance key. Replacing the keys might do the trick.

[HEADER 00004A6A]
Head into the bathroom and see what you can find.

[HEADER 00004A74]
Push the key into the soap to make an impression.

[HEADER 00004A7E]
Use the plaster in the soap, then add water from the sink, then use the hand drier to dry it. One fake key.

[HEADER 00004A88]
This key won't fool the guard. It's the wrong colour.

[HEADER 00004A92]
You need to find some paint. Who just had paint?

[HEADER 00004A9C]
Head up and try and dip the key in the paint bucket.

[HEADER 00004AA6]
Return downstairs, and use the phone on the wall, and talk to Nico.

[HEADER 00004AB0]
Head up and tell the painter he's needed on the phone. Now you can dip the key in the bucket of paint.

[HEADER 00004AC4]
This plaster key may look real, but it doesn't feel real.

[HEADER 00004ACE]
Imagine if the guard couldn't feel things with his fingers...

[HEADER 00004AD8]
Check the thermostat on the wall, then talk to the guard about it.

[HEADER 00004AE2]
Turn the thermostat right down, until the guard puts his gloves on.

[HEADER 00004AEC]
Get the keys back from the guard and combine his keys with your fake key to swap them. Then give the keys to the guard.

[HEADER 00004AF6]
Well, I have the key, but the guard's still in the way of the door.

[HEADER 00004B00]
How did you distract someone last time?

[HEADER 00004B0A]
Give Nico another call.

[HEADER 00004B14]
Once the guard is distracted, head back down.

[HEADER 00004B1E]
Finally I'm in the Baphomet site. There's a mosaic on the floor, but I can't make sense of it.

[HEADER 00004B28]
You need to reflect on this matter.

[HEADER 00004B32]
What do you have that's shiny like a mirror?

[HEADER 00004B3C]
Use the chalice on the mosaic.

[HEADER 0028000D]
The guard was telling the painter there was a call for him...

[HEADER 0028000E]
...and the painter wasn't believing a word of it.

[HEADER 0028000B]
The painter didn't seem to regard the painting as too important.

[HEADER 0028000C]
Not as important as his cigarette break, anyhow.

[HEADER 00280015]
Hi, it's me again.

[HEADER 00280018]
What now?

[HEADER 00280014]
Excuse me, could you help me?

[HEADER 00280016]
What is it?

[HEADER 00280017]
I've got a few questions.

[HEADER 0028002E]
What does the word `Templar' suggest to you?

[HEADER 0028002F]
Templar? Uh...

[HEADER 00280030]
Nothing?

[HEADER 00280031]
Nothing.

[HEADER 0028001A]
You're doing a fine job.

[HEADER 0028001B]
Merci. I have my professional pride.

[HEADER 0028001C]
I don't think I've ever seen a Gauloise smoked so stylishly.

[HEADER 0028001D]
It's a natural talent.

[HEADER 0028001E]
I'm being sarcastic.

[HEADER 0028001F]
I'm being indifferent.

[HEADER 00280020]
You're very good at that as well.

[HEADER 00280021]
Merci. Vive l'indifference!

[HEADER 00280022]
So what are you doing here?

[HEADER 00280023]
I am having my break.

[HEADER 00280024]
Yeah, I mean when you finish your break.

[HEADER 00280025]
When I finish my break? An interesting concept, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00280026]
You'll probably need to think about it.

[HEADER 00280027]
I could have another cigarette while I consider.

[HEADER 00280028]
Per'aps tomorrow, too.

[HEADER 00280029]
Okay, let me put things differently. What were you hired to do here?

[HEADER 0028002A]
I was hired to keep the archaeological dig in the basement of this building clear of debris...

[HEADER 0028002B]
...and to touch up damage to the doorframes with my little pot of paint.

[HEADER 0028002C]
It's a very responsible job.

[HEADER 0028002D]
Unfortunately, I'm not a very responsible person.

[HEADER 00280032]
So what do you know about the excavation?

[HEADER 00280033]
I know they won't let me in to do my job.

[HEADER 00280034]
I would complain to my union but, alas...

[HEADER 00280035]
...you couldn't be bothered to join.

[HEADER 00280036]
Right. Tell you what, though,...

[HEADER 00280037]
...I'm surprised at the sort of people interested in this excavation!

[HEADER 00280038]
What's unusual about the visitors to the excavation?

[HEADER 00280039]
None of them look like archaeologists to me.

[HEADER 0028003A]
Do you know what an archaeologist looks like?

[HEADER 0028003B]
Three piece suits, crocodile hide attaché cases, Rolex Oysters...

[HEADER 0028003C]
But no archaeologist dresses like that!

[HEADER 0028003D]
Quite right, m'sieur. Quite right.

[HEADER 0028003E]
So who are they?

[HEADER 0028003F]
Who cares as long as they pay me?

[HEADER 00280040]
You've got a 'phone call.

[HEADER 00280041]
For me? Are you certain?

[HEADER 00280042]
It's a woman. She sounded hot!

[HEADER 00280043]
What women? You must be mistaken, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00280044]
Well, she asked for `that hunk of man with the nicotine fingers and his ass hanging out of his pants'.

[HEADER 00280045]
Certainly sounds like me.

[HEADER 00280046]
Stand back. It wouldn't do to keep the lady from her hunk.

[HEADER 00280055]
I was pretty sure the Shake 'n Shock had shot its bolt in Syria.

[HEADER 00280056]
I've got a sewer key.

[HEADER 00280057]
I used to work in the sewers.

[HEADER 00280058]
Oh? What happened?

[HEADER 00280059]
I had a cigarette break in a pocket of methane.

[HEADER 0028005A]
A manhole cover landed on the other side of the Seine and I was sacked.

[HEADER 00280077]
Have you ever seen a lens like this before?

[HEADER 00280078]
Only in my sister's pince-nez.

[HEADER 00280079]
They're as thick as the portholes in a submarine.

[HEADER 0028007A]
If she looks up suddenly, she breaks her nose.

[HEADER 0028007B]
You're joking!

[HEADER 0028007C]
Of course I'm joking. I don't have a sister.

[HEADER 00280073]
Has a guy calling himself Moerlin been nosing around?

[HEADER 00280074]
Was he wearing a tee-shirt with `My name is Moerlin' on it?

[HEADER 00280075]
I doubt it.

[HEADER 00280076]
Then how the hell am I supposed to know his name just by looking at him, huh?

[HEADER 0028006D]
Have you ever seen anything like this?

[HEADER 0028006E]
Yes. It's a communion chalice.

[HEADER 0028006F]
I know, you know. I used to be an altar boy.

[HEADER 00280070]
You?

[HEADER 00280071]
Yes, me. What's so funny about that?

[HEADER 00280072]
Uh, nothing.

[HEADER 0028005B]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 0028005C]
Yeah. He asked me a lot of questions, just like you.

[HEADER 0028005F]
I have a red nose.

[HEADER 00280060]
Imagine.

[HEADER 00280061]
A greasy tissue. Don't get it too close to my cigarette, m'sieur...

[HEADER 00280062]
...or there'll be a conflagration.

[HEADER 0028005D]
I've got a blood pressure gizmo.

[HEADER 0028005E]
How exciting for you.

[HEADER 00280063]
I have some plaster of Paris.

[HEADER 00280064]
Amazing.

[HEADER 00280065]
I made this key out of plaster.

[HEADER 00280066]
How thrilling. How clever. How pointless.

[HEADER 00280067]
I made this key out of plaster and paint.

[HEADER 00280068]
Convincing, isn't it?

[HEADER 00280069]
Hmmm. That shade of paint seems ... familiar.

[HEADER 0028006A]
Not that I care.

[HEADER 0028006B]
Would you be interested in soap?

[HEADER 0028006C]
Not at this exact moment, no.

[HEADER 00280053]
Be seeing you.

[HEADER 00280054]
Au revoir, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00280002]
Hmmm. Gunmetal paint. Interesting.

[HEADER 00280003]
The painter had a pot of gunmetal gray primer hanging from the barrier.

[HEADER 00280011]
Ey! M'sieur! Get away from my paint pot!

[HEADER 00280012]
Okay...

[HEADER 00280013]
I should think so. Meddling with a man's paint pot! Pah!

[HEADER 00280004]
What would I need a whole pot of paint for?

[HEADER 00280005]
There was a dumpster full of debris from the excavation, I guessed.

[HEADER 00280000]
A well-used wheelbarrow was sitting by the rubble filled dumpster.

[HEADER 00280010]
Hey, you! Get away from my dumpster!

[HEADER 00280006]
The archway was topped by a fancy balustrade.

[HEADER 00280007]
Oh, darn. I'd left my grappling hook at home.

[HEADER 00280008]
No way could I get up there!

[HEADER 00290019]
The doorway was full of assorted old tea chests, cardboard boxes and so on, all empty and all uninteresting.

[HEADER 0029001A]
The doorway led to an old utility closet that had lost its door.

[HEADER 0029001B]
There was nothing interesting in there.

[HEADER 0029000E]
Yup, that was definitely debris.

[HEADER 0029000D]
A dumpster with some debris in it.

[HEADER 0029000F]
I couldn't see any use for a collection of dirt and half bricks.

[HEADER 00290006]
A thermostat was mounted over a radiator.

[HEADER 00290009]
I'd turned the thermostat all the way down. It was getting pretty chilly.

[HEADER 00290007]
The radiator was pumping out heat as the thermostat was cranked right over to full.

[HEADER 00290008]
No wonder it was warm in here even with the door open to the chill of Fall.

[HEADER 0029000A]
I turned the heating off.

[HEADER 0000184C]
As I'd hoped, the guard put his gloves on.

[HEADER 0029000C]
I couldn't imagine what I'd achieve by turning the dial.

[HEADER 00290029]
Hey! M'sieur!

[HEADER 0029002A]
Don't go with my keys!

[HEADER 00290012]
There was a closed door with `Toilet' scratched into the cheap veneer.

[HEADER 00290013]
The door was locked.

[HEADER 00290028]
That door's locked, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00290014]
That guard had been put here to guard something.

[HEADER 00290015]
My guess was that the excavation was behind that door.

[HEADER 00290016]
I didn't think that the guard would just let me waltz past. Besides...

[HEADER 00290017]
...I had a hunch that door was locked.

[HEADER 00290018]
I couldn't get to the door while the guard was there.

[HEADER 00290010]
A guard stood by a door I guessed led to the excavation.

[HEADER 00290011]
He looked pretty pompous. Well - not so much pretty, just pompous.

[HEADER 0029002F]
Hi, again.

[HEADER 00290031]
What is it?

[HEADER 0029002E]
Hi? Excuse me?

[HEADER 00290030]
Oui?

[HEADER 0029004A]
What do you know about the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 0029004B]
There was a long pause during which the guard said nothing. Then he said...

[HEADER 0029004C]
Nothing.

[HEADER 0029004D]
Nothing at all?

[HEADER 0029004E]
Is this a test?

[HEADER 0029004F]
What? Like a history pop test?

[HEADER 00290050]
No. Like a ...test.

[HEADER 00290051]
Okay, yes. It's a test.

[HEADER 00290052]
Then I know absolutely nothing about the Templars.

[HEADER 00290053]
The guard was being amazingly evasive. It was going to take more than goodwill to get past him.

[HEADER 00290033]
So, what exactly are you doing here?

[HEADER 00290034]
I'm guarding. You expect to find me shearing sheep?

[HEADER 00290035]
Take it easy! I just didn't realise you were a guard.

[HEADER 00290036]
I'd like to know what you're guarding, please?

[HEADER 00290037]
That's a secret.

[HEADER 00290038]
It wouldn't happen to be an archaeological site, would it?

[HEADER 00290039]
Are you asking me or telling me?

[HEADER 0029003A]
I'm telling you.

[HEADER 0029003B]
Then why ask?

[HEADER 0029003C]
I had a feeling that this was no normal hole in the ground.

[HEADER 00290046]
I need to use the, uh... toilet. Again.

[HEADER 00290047]
Again? Already?

[HEADER 00290048]
I have this problem. How technical do you want me to get?

[HEADER 00290049]
Never mind. Here's the key.

[HEADER 00290043]
I'd like to use the washroom but the door's locked.

[HEADER 00290044]
Oh, that's no problem. You can have the key.

[HEADER 00290045]
Thanks!

[HEADER 0029003D]
Boy, it sure is hot in here!

[HEADER 0029003E]
I have to have the door open to allow the workmen access so, why not?

[HEADER 0029003F]
I turned the heat up.

[HEADER 00290040]
You could wrap up warm.

[HEADER 00290041]
I have my gloves if it gets cold but why bother when it's warm anyway?

[HEADER 00290056]
I held my breath and hoped that he wouldn't notice the substitution.

[HEADER 00290057]
Here's the keys. Thanks.

[HEADER 00290058]
Merci, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00290059]
I couldn't give him the keys.

[HEADER 0029005A]
The false key looked pretty convincing but it felt exactly like what it was - painted plaster!

[HEADER 0029005B]
He was bound to detect it.

[HEADER 0029005C]
Here's the keys. Thanks.

[HEADER 0029005D]
Merci, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00290067]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 00290068]
Oh!

[HEADER 00290069]
You have?

[HEADER 0029006A]
Uh... non.

[HEADER 0029006B]
The conspiracy knew that the lens existed.

[HEADER 0029006C]
I figured it wouldn't be smart to show too many people that I had it.

[HEADER 0029006D]
I've got a red nose, here.

[HEADER 0029006E]
Oh.

[HEADER 00290071]
Look, a tissue stained with greasepaint.

[HEADER 00290072]
Ah, just what I've always wanted!

[HEADER 00290073]
If you give me that, you can enter through the door!

[HEADER 00290074]
Really?

[HEADER 00290075]
Of course not. What would I want with an old tissue?

[HEADER 00290076]
This here's a blood pressure gauge.

[HEADER 00290077]
Ah! Don't talk to me about blood pressure!

[HEADER 00290078]
My doctor said to...

[HEADER 00290079]
Okay, I won't talk to you about blood pressure.

[HEADER 0029007A]
I've got...

[HEADER 0029007B]
I thought better of showing him the chalice.

[HEADER 0029007C]
He might be on the conspiracy's payroll and I didn't want to risk it.

[HEADER 0029007D]
Oui? You have...?

[HEADER 0029007E]
...a sudden urge to sing. Care to join me?

[HEADER 0029007F]
Non. No singing in here.

[HEADER 00290080]
After the amount of trouble I'd been through to get that key...

[HEADER 00290081]
...I wasn't about to share with the guard how clever I'd been.

[HEADER 00290065]
This gadget is a sewer key.

[HEADER 00290066]
So it is.

[HEADER 00290061]
Do you recognise this name?

[HEADER 00290062]
Moerlin? Non.

[HEADER 0029005F]
I got this plaster from Ireland.

[HEADER 00290060]
Not an exciting souvenir.

[HEADER 00290054]
Talk to you later.

[HEADER 00290055]
Au revoir, m'sieur.

[HEADER 002B0015]
Oh boy, dirty soap. How do they do that?

[HEADER 00001843]
I didn't need to use the soap again.

[HEADER 002B0016]
The taps were rusty. Oh, boy.

[HEADER 002B0018]
I figured washing my hands with that soap in that sink would just get my hands dirtier than when I'd started.

[HEADER 002B0019]
That was a smart way to get a key made out of water.

[HEADER 002B001A]
Now all I needed was a nitrogen bath to freeze it in and I'd have a usable key.

[HEADER 00200000]
Several minutes later...

[HEADER 002B001B]
Well, it had taken a while but I had made myself a completely unconvincing plaster key.

[HEADER 002B001C]
Way too fragile to use in a lock. I'd have to substitute it for the real one.

[HEADER 002B001D]
Trouble was, it looked like plaster and not metal.

[HEADER 002B001E]
Then again, that plaster statue in Syria hadn't looked like stone until I'd been a bit `artful' with it.

[HEADER 002B001F]
Maybe I could improve the key as well.

[HEADER 002B0017]
The cold tap's washer looked to have failed. It was just dribbling down the sink.

[HEADER 002B0020]
On the wall was an automatic hand drier.

[HEADER 002B0021]
I wasn't about to wash my hands in this place so I didn't need to dry them.

[HEADER 002B000B]
Being in a charming comfort station like this made me think fondly of the toilet in Syria.

[HEADER 002B000C]
That place was kept in pretty good order.

[HEADER 002B000D]
At least, it had been until I vandalised it. Still, it was all for a good cause.

[HEADER 002B000A]
I didn't need to get near to tell the toilet needed cleaning.

[HEADER 002B0003]
There was a big, old boiler used for heating the building.

[HEADER 002B0004]
The thing felt really hot. Big demands seemed to be being made on it.

[HEADER 002B0005]
A huge pile of coal lay in the corner to fuel the boiler.

[HEADER 002B0006]
Real high tech stuff.

[HEADER 002B0007]
I didn't want any coal.

[HEADER 00290003]
I knew she'd lose her patience if I didn't get the painter soon.

[HEADER 00290002]
Nico was still waiting on the phone.

[HEADER 00290000]
There was a telephone on the far wall.

[HEADER 0029002B]
Do you mind if I use the phone?

[HEADER 0029002C]
Be my guest. I'm paid to guard this door.

[HEADER 0029002D]
The 'phone can look after itself.

[HEADER 00290082]
Hi? Nico?

[HEADER 00290083]
George! What have you discovered?

[HEADER 00290084]
Nothing yet.

[HEADER 00290085]
Nothing? Is something wrong?

[HEADER 00290086]
No.

[HEADER 00290087]
George, why are you calling me?

[HEADER 00290088]
Oh, no reason. Just wanted to hear your voice.

[HEADER 00290089]
Did you? Well, this is my voice saying don't bother me, I'm busy!

[HEADER 0029008A]
Oh.

[HEADER 002900A2]
Hello, Nico. It's me.

[HEADER 002900A3]
What do you want?

[HEADER 002900A4]
Some ideas.

[HEADER 002900A5]
You're the man on the spot, George.

[HEADER 002900A6]
I can't hold your hand all of the time. Au revoir.

[HEADER 0029008B]
Collard.

[HEADER 00290091]
Hi, George! What's happening?

[HEADER 00290092]
I'm at the excavation but they won't let me in.

[HEADER 00290093]
Damn! We need to know what's in there!

[HEADER 00290094]
Don't worry, I've got a scheme. I'm going to need your help though.

[HEADER 00290095]
Okay, what do you want me to do?

[HEADER 00290096]
I want you to keep somebody on the 'phone for a while.

[HEADER 00290097]
Who?

[HEADER 00290098]
A painter. I need to get at his pot.

[HEADER 00290099]
Oh, okay.

[HEADER 0029009A]
Stay on the line, I'll go and get him.

[HEADER 0029009B]
Hi, Nico! It's me again!

[HEADER 0029009C]
I'd guessed. What do you want this time?

[HEADER 0029009D]
What did you say to the painter?

[HEADER 0029009E]
I shan't repeat it, George.

[HEADER 0029009F]
Look, I need to get the guard out of the way.

[HEADER 002900A0]
Could you call back and ask him to get the painter again?

[HEADER 002900A1]
Okay, I'll call back soon.

[HEADER 00290001]
I figured I'd best not bother Nico again until I'd got a good reason.

[HEADER 0029001D]
Well, m'sieur! What a strange woman!

[HEADER 0029001E]
She was all over me and then, suddenly - nothing but abuse!

[HEADER 0029001F]
Really?

[HEADER 00290020]
Oui - abuse! Ah, well. I have a cigarette to finish.

[HEADER 00290021]
And, m'sieur, if she calls again... I'm not available.

[HEADER 0028007D]
This looked like a good place to watch things develop...

[HEADER 0028007E]
Hey, you! It's the 'phone.

[HEADER 0028007F]
Yeah?

[HEADER 00280080]
Who is it?

[HEADER 00280081]
How should I know? What am I, your social secretary?

[HEADER 00280082]
It's not a chick, is it?

[HEADER 00280083]
Yes, it's a woman. Are you going to answer it?

[HEADER 00280084]
Does she have a warm, sensual voice like molten chocolate?

[HEADER 00280085]
Yes, yes. She has a really sexy voice. Now get a move on!

[HEADER 00280086]
I'm not talking to her.

[HEADER 00280087]
I can see that! You're wasting time talking to me!

[HEADER 00280088]
Non, you don't understand. I refuse to talk to her.

[HEADER 00280089]
You refuse? You REFUSE? I'm wasting valuable time...

[HEADER 0028008A]
Don't make me laugh! Your time, valuable? You just stand around all day!

[HEADER 0028008B]
I have a highly responsible job!

[HEADER 0028008C]
Pah!

[HEADER 0028008D]
Don't `Pah!' me, you elephantine oaf! My job is important!

[HEADER 0028008E]
Impossible. They would've hired somebody competent in that case...

[HEADER 0028008F]
Meaning what?

[HEADER 00280090]
Instead of which they hired a dismal rent-a-cop like you...

[HEADER 00280091]
...all epaulettes and no brains.

[HEADER 00280092]
Why, you...

[HEADER 00280093]
This looked set to carry on for some time. It was too good an opportunity to miss.

[HEADER 0028000F]
It looked like he had enough problems without me interfering.

[HEADER 002A0010]
Some planks used to make the catwalk were leaning against the wall.

[HEADER 002A0011]
I couldn't see anything useful to do with the planks.

[HEADER 002A0000]
Oh, great. More dead people.

[HEADER 002A0003]
No, thanks. I think I'm carrying enough junk.

[HEADER 002A0007]
There was no doubt about it...

[HEADER 002A0008]
...it was the same sort of idol I'd seen in Syria.

[HEADER 002A0009]
Baphomet. The Templars had certainly been through here.

[HEADER 002A0004]
Now there's a familiar face...

[HEADER 002A000A]
In the middle of the floor was a weird mosaic...

[HEADER 002A000B]
...all swirling and distorted.

[HEADER 002A000E]
And there it was, decoded by the curves of the chalice...

[HEADER 002A000F]
... the image of a church.

[HEADER 002A000C]
Close up, the pattern didn't make any sort of sense.

[HEADER 002A000D]
It fanned out around an axis point, a kind of focus to one side.

[HEADER 0000183A]
Perhaps I could make a copy of the key...

[HEADER 0000183B]
The key had made a clear imprint in the soap.

[HEADER 0000183C]
I'd already created the right impression.

[HEADER 0000183D]
I knew keeping that plaster was a good idea.

[HEADER 0000183E]
With the plaster in the imprint I was on the right lines.

[HEADER 0000183F]
I couldn't do that...

[HEADER 00001838]
The key's imprint was now filled with wet plaster.

[HEADER 00000027]
I had filled the key's imprint in the soap with dry plaster.

[HEADER 00000026]
The bar of soap had the imprint of a key in it.

[HEADER 00001839]
I didn't want to carry a bar of dirty soap around with me.

[HEADER 00001840]
You can't make a cast without wetting the plaster...

[HEADER 00001841]
...but wet plaster alone does not make a cast.

[HEADER 00001842]
I used the dryer to speed up the process...
