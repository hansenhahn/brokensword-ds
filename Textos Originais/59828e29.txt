[HEADER 00002F6C]
I can't get the door to Nico's apartment to open.

[HEADER 00002F76]
Maybe there's somebody in the street who could help.

[HEADER 00002F80]
Chat to the flower seller about Nico.

[HEADER 000032C8]
I have talked to Nico but don't know how to progress.

[HEADER 000032D2]
Try showing the clown's nose to Nico.

[HEADER 000032DC]
I need to know more about the clown.

[HEADER 000032E6]
You know that the clown was wearing clothing with a distinct pattern - try showing the scrap of material to Nico.

[HEADER 000B000F]
It was an antique phonograph, the kind you have to wind by hand.

[HEADER 000B0000]
The guys spoon-shaped face was mournful and humourless.

[HEADER 000B0001]
He looked like a vegetarian in a slaughter-house.

[HEADER 000B0010]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 000B0012]
Bonjour, m'sieur!

[HEADER 000B0013]
Please - come in, welcome.

[HEADER 000B0014]
Leave the mundane world behind for in these four walls - fantasy is king!

[HEADER 000B0015]
I don't want a costume.

[HEADER 000B0016]
Didn't you ever dress up when you were a child?

[HEADER 000B0017]
Not that I remember.

[HEADER 000B0018]
Incredible!

[HEADER 000B0019]
You'll be telling me next that you never shared your elder sister's lingerie!

[HEADER 000B001A]
I don't have a sister, and I'd look silly in a brassiere.

[HEADER 000B001B]
I just need some information.

[HEADER 000B001C]
Of course. How can I help you?

[HEADER 000B001D]
Oui, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000B001E]
I'm looking for a man who hired a clown costume from you...

[HEADER 000B001F]
That man whose photograph you showed me, he hired two costumes!

[HEADER 000B0020]
Two?

[HEADER 000B0021]
Yes - Bozo the clown and Seamus the Pixie.

[HEADER 000B0022]
What was his name?

[HEADER 000B0023]
Khan. A Middle-Eastern man, I would think.

[HEADER 000B0024]
And did he have the scar on his face?

[HEADER 000B0025]
That's right. In the shape of a crescent moon...

[HEADER 000B0026]
Oui, m'sieur? I do not see how I can help.

[HEADER 000B0027]
Don't you keep a record of costumes that you've rented out?

[HEADER 000B0028]
Of course, m'sieur, but....

[HEADER 000B0029]
Well, then - I'd like you to check your records.

[HEADER 000B002A]
Give me the names of everyone who has rented a clown suit.

[HEADER 000B002B]
Impossible! There are too many!

[HEADER 000B002C]
The clown I'm looking for is a cold-blooded killer.

[HEADER 000B002D]
Give me his name, and I'll see he's brought to justice.

[HEADER 000B002E]
I'd help you if I could, but you can't expect me to remember all my customers.

[HEADER 000B002F]
You see, the clown costume is our most popular line, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000B0030]
On average, we hire out more than thirty clown suits a week.

[HEADER 000B0031]
You'll have to give me more to go by. A description, per'aps?

[HEADER 000B0032]
How come clowns are so popular?

[HEADER 000B0033]
I think it has something to do with their unpredictable nature.

[HEADER 000B0034]
Personally, I think clowns should be banned, along with mimes.

[HEADER 000B0035]
Oh, come now - who doesn't love clowns?

[HEADER 000B0036]
Me, for one.

[HEADER 000B0037]
Have you heard of a man named Plantard?

[HEADER 000B0038]
I do not recall anyone of that name.

[HEADER 000B0043]
Do you want this red nose back?

[HEADER 000B0044]
Not after it's been worn, thank you.

[HEADER 000B0045]
What does this tool mean to you?

[HEADER 000B0046]
Nothing, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000B003D]
Do you want this buzzer back?

[HEADER 000B003E]
No - you keep it.

[HEADER 000B003B]
What does this key mean to you?

[HEADER 000B003C]
I don't recognise it.

[HEADER 000B003F]
What would you give me for this ball?

[HEADER 000B0040]
Ten sous.

[HEADER 000B0041]
Oh. That's not much, is it?

[HEADER 000B0042]
It's not much of a ball.

[HEADER 000B0047]
Do you recognize this cloth?

[HEADER 000B0048]
Oui.

[HEADER 000B0049]
You do?

[HEADER 000B004A]
Mais oui!

[HEADER 000B004B]
It is the same as the suit which Monsieur Khan was wearing.

[HEADER 000B004C]
I served a man wearing a suit made from the same material.

[HEADER 000B004D]
Do you remember his name?

[HEADER 000B004E]
Non.

[HEADER 000B0051]
Are you sure this is the man who bought greasepaint?

[HEADER 000B0052]
Oui, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000B004F]
Are you sure this is the same man who hired the clown suit?

[HEADER 000B0050]
Certainement - Monsieur Khan.

[HEADER 000B0053]
Do you recognize this man?

[HEADER 000B0059]
Oui, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000B005C]
I sold him some greasepaint.

[HEADER 000B0054]
Ah, oui! He was here this morning.

[HEADER 000B005A]
That is the man to whom I sold the greasepaint.

[HEADER 000B005B]
I remember the scar on his face.

[HEADER 000B0055]
He chose two costumes: Bozo the Clown, and Seamus the Pixie.

[HEADER 000B0056]
A pixie?

[HEADER 000B0057]
Very smart. Green silk with a taffeta lining.

[HEADER 000B0058]
He gave me his name as Monsieur Khan.

[HEADER 000B005D]
Does this dirty tissue mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000B005E]
Hmm! Let me smell that...

[HEADER 000B005F]
Bestheimer's number seven, white pancake.

[HEADER 000B0060]
Theatrical greasepaint, right?

[HEADER 000B0061]
Oui, m'sieur. La crème de la crème of thespian accoutrement.

[HEADER 000B0062]
Have you sold any of it recently?

[HEADER 000B0063]
Yes. Two cans.

[HEADER 000B0064]
About this tissue...

[HEADER 000B0065]
I have already given you my professional opinion.

[HEADER 000B0039]
Thanks for your help, buddy...

[HEADER 000B003A]
My pleasure, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000B0066]
Allow me to shake you by the hand...

[HEADER 000B0067]
Huh? Well... okay.

[HEADER 000B0068]
What are you trying to do - kill me?

[HEADER 000B0069]
You did not find it amusing?

[HEADER 000B006A]
I never saw the funny side of electro-shock therapy.

[HEADER 000B006B]
Eh bien - it is yours to keep. A gift.

[HEADER 000B006C]
Do I need a license?

[HEADER 000B006D]
Non, but I give you a word of warning, m'sieur...

[HEADER 000B006E]
What?

[HEADER 000B006F]
Remember to switch it off before you visit the toilet.

[HEADER 00090000]
The woman was doing something with a pair of needles that couldn't be described as knitting.

[HEADER 00090001]
She was a cheery old soul, the kind you'd walk across the street to avoid.

[HEADER 00090015]
Oh hi!

[HEADER 00090017]
Bonjour, m'sieur!

[HEADER 00090018]
Would you like me to foretell your future?

[HEADER 00090019]
Oh... no, thanks.

[HEADER 0009001A]
I'm very good, and it only takes a minute!

[HEADER 0009001B]
Thanks all the same, but I'm not superstitious.

[HEADER 0009001C]
Besides, if it only takes a minute, that's not much of a future to look forward to...

[HEADER 0009001D]
Bonjour, m'sieur! How's your girlfriend?

[HEADER 0009001E]
She's not my girlfriend.

[HEADER 0009001F]
Maybe not yet... but I see your paths entwined in the future.

[HEADER 00090020]
I doubt it.

[HEADER 00090021]
Hallo, my handsome friend.

[HEADER 00090022]
I've changed my mind. Will you tell my fortune?

[HEADER 00090023]
You're going on a long journey.

[HEADER 00090024]
My, oh my. What a surprise.

[HEADER 00090025]
Can you tell me anything I don't already know?

[HEADER 00090029]
How does this fortune telling routine work?

[HEADER 0009002A]
If I knew that I wouldn't be selling flowers for a living.

[HEADER 0009002B]
Haven't you ever wondered why you were blessed with the gift?

[HEADER 0009002C]
Well, it's a bit like satellite television I suppose.

[HEADER 0009002D]
Some of us are born with a built-in receiver dish.

[HEADER 0009002E]
I just happen to be one of the lucky ones.

[HEADER 0009002F]
Can you really foretell the future?

[HEADER 00090030]
Only time will tell, m'sieur!

[HEADER 00090031]
The strange thing is, I can't seem to see myself in the future.

[HEADER 00090032]
Other people - I have no problem.

[HEADER 00090033]
But when I try to see what might happen to me - nothing!

[HEADER 00090034]
That must be scary.

[HEADER 00090035]
Maybe. I figure it's a kind of natural safety mechanism.

[HEADER 00090036]
Either that, or I don't have a future.

[HEADER 00090037]
Do you know a young woman called Nicole Collard?

[HEADER 00090038]
Yes, I do!

[HEADER 00090039]
She lives upstairs from me, in the apartment block across the street.

[HEADER 0009003A]
I tried the door, but it's locked.

[HEADER 0009003B]
You know, I've told the landlord about that a million times!

[HEADER 0009003C]
It is the damp. That whole building is like a sponge!

[HEADER 0009003D]
It sucks up the moisture from God knows where.

[HEADER 0009003E]
You mean the door is stuck because it's swollen?

[HEADER 0009003F]
That is correct. There is an art to opening it.

[HEADER 00090040]
Don't shove it hard - just give it a gentle nudge above the lock!

[HEADER 00090041]
Thanks for the advice...

[HEADER 00090042]
The door isn't locked, but you'll need to give it a gentle nudge.

[HEADER 00090043]
It sticks, you see - because of the damp.

[HEADER 00090044]
The landlord said he'd fix it before winter sets in.

[HEADER 00090045]
He's been saying that for three years.

[HEADER 00090046]
How long has Mademoiselle Collard lived here?

[HEADER 00090047]
A few months. She's in for a shock when the cold weather comes.

[HEADER 00090048]
Drafty windows, insufficient heating - it's a struggle to keep warm.

[HEADER 00090049]
The only reason I stay is because the rent is cheap.

[HEADER 0009004A]
Your young lady - she deserves better.

[HEADER 0009004B]
I thought Mademoiselle Collard was a successful photographer...

[HEADER 0009004C]
Not as successful as she makes out, for all her fine clothes.

[HEADER 0009004D]
Oh, I've heard her crying herself to sleep at night.

[HEADER 0009004E]
That's awful.

[HEADER 0009004F]
Now don't you let on that I've told you.

[HEADER 00090050]
She's proud, that one - too proud, if you ask me.

[HEADER 00090051]
Have you seen anyone out here, watching Mademoiselle Collard's apartment?

[HEADER 00090052]
Yes, I have. A strange man, tall and thin as a broomstick.

[HEADER 00090053]
He kept his face hidden, but I saw his eyes, peering from evil little slits.

[HEADER 00090054]
How was he dressed?

[HEADER 00090055]
A long brown raincoat, with a hat.

[HEADER 00090056]
Like Humphrey Bogart?

[HEADER 00090057]
Yes, but he didn't have Bogart's charisma.

[HEADER 00090058]
Besides, this guy looked like he needed a toilet...

[HEADER 00090059]
You never saw Bogart clenching his buttocks like that!

[HEADER 00001E40]
Is there anything else you can tell me about Ms. Collard?

[HEADER 00090082]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0009005A]
Are the flowers for sale?

[HEADER 0009005B]
Oui, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0009005C]
Okay, I'll take a bunch of those white ones.

[HEADER 0009005D]
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

[HEADER 0009005E]
No?

[HEADER 0009005F]
They are lilies, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00090060]
Some people associate them with death...

[HEADER 00090061]
Yikes! Thanks for telling me.

[HEADER 00090062]
What other flowers do you have?

[HEADER 00090063]
Dahlias?

[HEADER 00090064]
What do they signify?

[HEADER 00090065]
Insecurity.

[HEADER 00090066]
Hmm. I don't want to give her the wrong idea about me...

[HEADER 00090067]
What about the tall yellow ones?

[HEADER 00090068]
Those are iris, the flame of passion!

[HEADER 00090069]
And the little yellow ones?

[HEADER 0009006A]
Sensuality.

[HEADER 0009006B]
They're no use to me.

[HEADER 0009006C]
I want to make an impression, not jump down her throat...

[HEADER 00090071]
Can you tell me anything about this security pass?

[HEADER 00090072]
I can tell it doesn't belong to you...

[HEADER 00090073]
How come?

[HEADER 00090074]
Give me some credit!

[HEADER 00090075]
If you're an electrician, I'll eat my antirrhinums.

[HEADER 00090076]
You're a remarkably talented lady.

[HEADER 00090081]
Do you know anything about medieval manuscripts?

[HEADER 00090079]
Do you recognise this nose?

[HEADER 0009007A]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00090086]
What can you tell me about this material?

[HEADER 00090087]
It's a very expensive piece of cloth, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00090088]
What can you tell me about this tissue?

[HEADER 00090089]
Nothing.

[HEADER 0009007B]
What do you make of this tool?

[HEADER 0009007C]
Is it something a dentist would use?

[HEADER 0009007D]
No. It's for raising manhole covers.

[HEADER 0009007E]
Formidable!

[HEADER 0009007F]
Did I show you this tool?

[HEADER 00090080]
Yes, my dear.

[HEADER 00090077]
What do you think of my ball?

[HEADER 00090078]
I'm picking up vibrations from it. That ball will travel far.

[HEADER 00090094]
Does this powder mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00090095]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 00090096]
Do you know what this tripod was used for?

[HEADER 00090097]
I couldn't imagine.

[HEADER 0009009F]
Does this lens mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000900A0]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 00090098]
What does this apparatus mean to you?

[HEADER 00090099]
The last time I saw one of those I was about to go to the operating theatre...

[HEADER 0009009A]
The doctor told me there was nothing to worry about.

[HEADER 0009009B]
I laughed in his face.

[HEADER 0009009C]
How come?

[HEADER 0009009D]
I can see the future, remember?

[HEADER 0009009E]
Don't remind me!

[HEADER 00090083]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00090084]
Non. But I can tell you one thing...

[HEADER 00090085]
There's no such place as the Club Alamut in Paris.

[HEADER 0009008A]
Do you recognise the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 0009008B]
Ooh, what a hunk!

[HEADER 0009008C]
He's a killer.

[HEADER 0009008D]
I can see that. His eyes say it all.

[HEADER 0009008E]
No, dear.

[HEADER 0009008F]
What do you make of this gem?

[HEADER 00090090]
Very nice, cherie.

[HEADER 00090091]
A present for your girlfriend?

[HEADER 00090092]
She's not my girlfriend.

[HEADER 00090093]
Nonsense! You and her were made for each other.

[HEADER 0009006F]
Would you like to shake my hand?

[HEADER 00090070]
No, I wouldn't. I can see the future, remember?

[HEADER 0009006D]
See you later...

[HEADER 0009006E]
That's right, m'sieur - you will!

[HEADER 00090002]
The door was shabby and in need of a coat of paint.

[HEADER 00090003]
I couldn't imagine the Collard woman living here.

[HEADER 00090004]
It was the door to Nico's apartment.

[HEADER 00090005]
I pushed against the door, but it seemed to be locked.

[HEADER 00090006]
Remembering the flower seller's advice, I pushed the door gently just above the lock...

[HEADER 008101B5]
Hi.

[HEADER 008101B7]
Bonjour! I'm glad you could make it, m'sieur...

[HEADER 008101B8]
Please - call me George.

[HEADER 008101B9]
Fine. I'm Nicole. Take a seat, George...

[HEADER 008101B6]
Oh, hello.

[HEADER 008101ED]
Did you see who planted the bomb?

[HEADER 008101EE]
I know it sounds crazy, but he was dressed like a clown!

[HEADER 008101EF]
A clown? It's him again...

[HEADER 008101BA]
Eh bien... and what have you been up to?

[HEADER 008101BB]
I've been exploring the sewers underneath the café.

[HEADER 008101BC]
I thought I could smell something bad.

[HEADER 008101BD]
The clown used the sewer to escape, and to change out of his costume.

[HEADER 008101BE]
I guess he was in a hurry. He left his jacket behind.

[HEADER 008101BF]
And?

[HEADER 008101C0]
I got his tailor's phone number.

[HEADER 008101C2]
You had better luck than I did.

[HEADER 008101C3]
Luck, she said. Luck! Hard work, I'd call it.

[HEADER 008101C4]
What happened?

[HEADER 00001E3C]
My editor told me to drop the story.  Can you believe it?

[HEADER 008101C7]
But you're not about to do that...

[HEADER 008101C8]
Oh, no. I'm going to find out what's behind these killings.

[HEADER 00001E3D]
It just doesn't add up.  It almost feels like some sort of conspiracy!

[HEADER 008101CA]
The police in three different countries have kept very quiet about the murders.

[HEADER 008101CB]
The press don't connect them at all.

[HEADER 008101CC]
They blame them on `political, religious or militant minority extremists.'

[HEADER 008101CD]
That covers just about everyone...

[HEADER 00810255]
Tell me more about the clown's previous victims.

[HEADER 00810256]
The first was Arno Bilotta, the millionaire pharmaceutical baron.

[HEADER 00810257]
He made his money from amphetamines, in the post-war slimming and diet boom.

[HEADER 00810258]
Imagine it! Millions of housewives, literally speeding their butts off!

[HEADER 0081025B]
The only witness in the case was his Filipino au pair.

[HEADER 0081025C]
She swears he was lured to his death by a snowman.

[HEADER 0081025D]
What about the clown's second victim?

[HEADER 0081025E]
Yamada, the controversial Japanese politician.

[HEADER 0081025F]
He inherited his fortune from his father's electro-chemical consortium.

[HEADER 00001E28]
How did he die?

[HEADER 00810264]
At the hands - or should I say, flippers - of a giant Emperor Penguin.

[HEADER 00810265]
A snowman, a penguin, and now a clown...

[HEADER 00001E3E]
I had been about to add 'mime' to the list, but stopped myself.

[HEADER 00001E3F]
I really didn't want to have to explain to George about my father's involvement with Carchon.

[HEADER 00810266]
You know, I hate to admit it, but this is scary...

[HEADER 00810267]
And I'll tell you this - I will not be accepting any invitations to costume parties.

[HEADER 00810268]
I don't blame you for being scared - I am too.

[HEADER 00810269]
But this story could be my only chance of a big break...

[HEADER 0081026A]
Or an early death.

[HEADER 00810237]
Who was the guy you were supposed to meet?

[HEADER 00810238]
His name was Plantard. I didn't know him, but he called me last night.

[HEADER 00810239]
He said he had a story which would interest me.

[HEADER 0081023A]
He asked me to meet him at the café.

[HEADER 0081023D]
How did Plantard get your name?

[HEADER 0081023E]
Through the newspaper - La Liberté.

[HEADER 0081023F]
I'd written an article linking two unsolved murders, one in Italy, the other in Japan.

[HEADER 00810240]
The cases were remarkably similar...

[HEADER 00810241]
...a wealthy victim, no apparent motive, and a costumed killer.

[HEADER 00810242]
Plantard said he could supply me with more information.

[HEADER 0081020E]
Tell me more about yourself...

[HEADER 0081020F]
Oh, there's not much to tell...

[HEADER 00810210]
Well, how did you get into photography?

[HEADER 00810211]
I guess I owe that to my father. He bought me my first camera.

[HEADER 00810212]
I was eight and my parents had just split up.

[HEADER 00810213]
Did you live with your father?

[HEADER 00810214]
Yes. My mother went off with her new boyfriend.

[HEADER 00810215]
I didn't mind. Papa was all I needed.

[HEADER 00810216]
Four years later he died in a plane crash.

[HEADER 00810217]
Oh - I'm sorry.

[HEADER 00810218]
It's all right; I don't mind talking about him.

[HEADER 00810219]
He was more like an older brother, really - always joking and laughing.

[HEADER 0081021A]
Papa always wanted me to study art. That's why I went to college.

[HEADER 0081021B]
Did you learn about photography at college?

[HEADER 0081021C]
God, no - I couldn't afford the materials.

[HEADER 0081021D]
We were billed for everything we used: paint, canvas, paper...

[HEADER 0081021E]
Most of my year turned to minimalism - it was cheaper.

[HEADER 0081021F]
I used to go poaching in the park for squirrel hair.

[HEADER 00810220]
The only time I wasn't hungry was the term I did printing...

[HEADER 00810221]
I used to eat the potatoes.

[HEADER 00810222]
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

[HEADER 00810223]
Oh, no!

[HEADER 00810311]
I found this false nose in the sewer...

[HEADER 00810312]
Hey! What's this inside it?

[HEADER 00810313]
The contents of someone's nose?

[HEADER 00810314]
Don't be gross, George.

[HEADER 00810315]
It says 'La risée du monde - masques et costumes'

[HEADER 00810316]
It has 'La risée du monde' printed inside it...

[HEADER 00810317]
The laughing stock of the world...

[HEADER 00810318]
It's a costume shop near the Gare St Lazare.

[HEADER 0081031A]
I'll check it out. Maybe the owner remembers who hired the clown costume.

[HEADER 0081031E]
I showed you the red nose, didn't I?

[HEADER 0081031F]
Yes - you did.

[HEADER 00810320]
Why don't you pay a visit to the shop it came from?

[HEADER 00810321]
I already did, but the manager couldn't help me.

[HEADER 00810322]
You shouldn't give up so easily, George.

[HEADER 00810323]
I just might do that...

[HEADER 0081031B]
Why don't you put it on, George?

[HEADER 0081031C]
No way am I wearing this - I'd look really stupid!

[HEADER 0081031D]
Besides, he might have had a cold...

[HEADER 0081036B]
I found this tissue down the sewer...

[HEADER 0081036C]
Pouah! That's disgusting, George!

[HEADER 0081036D]
I think the stuff on it is greasepaint. Like actors use... or clowns.

[HEADER 0081036E]
It's still disgusting! Get rid of it!

[HEADER 0081036F]
Did I show you this tissue?

[HEADER 00810370]
Yes, George. I asked you to get rid of it.

[HEADER 0081035C]
I found a piece of material near the café...

[HEADER 0081035F]
When I showed it to the concierge, he recognized it right away.

[HEADER 00810360]
It's very distinctive, all right.

[HEADER 00810361]
Just wait until you see this...

[HEADER 00810362]
I developed the film I shot at the café.

[HEADER 00810363]
Here, George - it's an enlargement I made.

[HEADER 00810364]
Look what that guy's wearing.

[HEADER 00810365]
Chequered pants. The same material as I found in the sewer.

[HEADER 00810366]
That's right. This guy shouldn't be difficult to find.

[HEADER 00810367]
Oh, no?

[HEADER 00001964]
Take a close look at his right cheek.

[HEADER 00810369]
A scar in the shape of a horseshoe!

[HEADER 0081036A]
...or a crescent moon.

[HEADER 00810324]
How come you enlarged this photograph of me?

[HEADER 00810325]
Because I noticed the guy behind you, of course.

[HEADER 00810330]
This is the tool I used to get into the sewers...

[HEADER 00810331]
Fascinating, George.

[HEADER 00810332]
You're not interested, are you?

[HEADER 00810333]
Of course I am. I think it was very brave of you to go down those sewers.

[HEADER 00810334]
Yeah? Well, it was kinda scary, but, well - I had a job to do.

[HEADER 00810335]
Yes, you showed me before.

[HEADER 00810353]
The guy at the novelty shop gave me this...

[HEADER 00810354]
What is it?

[HEADER 00810355]
A hand buzzer. You put it in your hand and give people electric shocks.

[HEADER 00810356]
Why?

[HEADER 00810357]
It's a gag. A practical joke.

[HEADER 00810358]
If you ever use that on me I'll break your arm.

[HEADER 00810359]
Okay, okay! I get the picture...

[HEADER 0081035A]
Hey, Nico - shake hands with me!

[HEADER 0081035B]
No chance, buster.

[HEADER 008102BB]
I have to go.

[HEADER 008102BE]
Okay. I'll see you later...

[HEADER 00120002]
It was a public telephone...

[HEADER 005A00A8]
Bonjour - Collard?

[HEADER 005A00A9]
Oh, hi. It's George Stobbart. The American at the café...

[HEADER 005A00AA]
I saw you, taking photographs.

[HEADER 005A00AB]
How did you get my number?

[HEADER 005A00AC]
The gendarme gave it me.

[HEADER 005A0003]
Hello, Nicole Collard.

[HEADER 005A0004]
Hello? It's George.

[HEADER 005A00B5]
Ah, oui!

[HEADER 005A00B6]
Uh... you said to call if I could help...

[HEADER 005A00B7]
Have you any news for me?

[HEADER 005A0005]
Oh, hi.

[HEADER 005A00BC]
You bet! I met a witness who spoke to the clown...

[HEADER 005A00BD]
...and I know where the killer gets his suits.

[HEADER 005A00BE]
No kidding? Hey, I'm impressed.

[HEADER 005A00BF]
You are? Well, it wasn't easy...

[HEADER 005A00C5]
I found the clown's escape route... I think.

[HEADER 005A00C6]
You think?

[HEADER 005A00C7]
He ran into a blind alley and took to the sewers.

[HEADER 005A00C8]
Very apt - but then what?

[HEADER 005A00C9]
I don't know. Maybe I could come see you?

[HEADER 005A00CA]
I really am very busy...

[HEADER 005A00CB]
Oh. Okay. I'll keep searching.

[HEADER 005A00CC]
Good. Be sure to let me know if you find anything.

[HEADER 005A00CD]
You can count on it.

[HEADER 005A00CE]
See you...

[HEADER 005A00CF]
Well, I haven't had a lot of luck...

[HEADER 005A00D0]
You've found nothing?

[HEADER 005A00D1]
Uh... no.

[HEADER 005A00D2]
Look - I'm very busy right now.

[HEADER 005A00D3]
Call me if you have any news, okay?

[HEADER 005A00D4]
Oh... yeah, I guess.

[HEADER 005A00D5]
Adieu, m'sieur.

[HEADER 005A00D6]
See you...

[HEADER 005A00D7]
Hello? Who is this?

[HEADER 005A00DC]
Hi! My name's George Stobbart. You don't know me.

[HEADER 005A00DD]
Correct, Mister Stobbart, I don't. What can I do for you?

[HEADER 005A00DE]
I'm trying to trace one of your customers.

[HEADER 005A00DF]
Could I maybe come over and talk to you?

[HEADER 005A00E0]
NO! No, that's not possible.

[HEADER 005A00E1]
Okay, forget it. Listen, all I want is a name.

[HEADER 005A00E2]
What are you talking about? Who are you working for?

[HEADER 005A00E3]
I guess you might say I'm acting in the interests of Truth and Justice.

[HEADER 005A00E4]
Ah, thank God! I thought you were the police...

[HEADER 005A00E5]
There are innocent lives at stake, mister Todryk - lives that you could save.

[HEADER 005A00E6]
You're collecting for charity, yes?

[HEADER 005A00E7]
No, I'm not. All I want from you is information.

[HEADER 005A00E8]
Go on, I'm listening...

[HEADER 005A00DA]
Mister Todryk?

[HEADER 005A00DB]
Oh, it's you again. What now?

[HEADER 005A00E9]
What do you know about the clown who bombed the Café de la Chandelle Verte?

[HEADER 005A00EA]
I don't have no idea what you're talking about.

[HEADER 005A00EB]
You're cool, Todryk, but I think you know more than you're saying.

[HEADER 005A00EC]
I don't know who you be, but sure I am you don't know what you're talking about!

[HEADER 005A00EE]
Oh, this is ridiculous. Quit playing games with me, Todryk.

[HEADER 005A00EF]
I tell you I know nothing about no clown.

[HEADER 005A00F0]
Did you know that one of your customers was a part-time clown?

[HEADER 005A00F1]
If a guy feels happy with a funny nose and custard down his pants, what's the problem?

[HEADER 005A00F2]
Do you know a guy called Plantard?

[HEADER 005A00F3]
No. I never heard of him.

[HEADER 005A00F4]
Shall I tell you what happened to Plantard?

[HEADER 005A00F5]
How he was killed in cold blood?

[HEADER 005A00F6]
I told you - I never heard of Plantard.

[HEADER 005A00F7]
I expect Plantard's a family man, don't you?

[HEADER 005A00F8]
In their little apartment, Madame Plantard is cooking the supper...

[HEADER 005A00F9]
Listening for the familiar sound of her husband's key in the door.

[HEADER 005A00FA]
Junior is waiting for his daddy to come home from work.

[HEADER 005A00FB]
He can't wait to show him the merit marks he earned in school today.

[HEADER 005A00FC]
Only tonight... Monsieur Plantard won't be coming home.

[HEADER 005A00FD]
You forgot the puppy.

[HEADER 005A00FE]
Huh?

[HEADER 005A00FF]
The faithful puppy dog, waiting for the sound of his master's voice...?

[HEADER 005A0100]
Maybe they don't have a dog. What do you think?

[HEADER 005A0101]
I don't know Plantard, I never heard of Plantard.

[HEADER 005A0102]
None of this has anything to do with me!

[HEADER 005A010A]
The man I'm looking for is called Khan.

[HEADER 005A010B]
He bought a suit from you - remember?

[HEADER 005A010C]
Mister Khan...

[HEADER 005A010D]
Yes - I remember him.

[HEADER 005A010E]
Yes. I delivered the suit to his hotel.

[HEADER 005A010F]
The Hôtel Ubu. I don't remember the room number.

[HEADER 005A0110]
It was upstairs - the second room on the right hand side of the corridor.

[HEADER 005A0111]
Thanks, Todryk. That's all I wanted to know.

[HEADER 005A0112]
Now I've got you, Mister Clown...

[HEADER 005A0103]
Did you make a suit for a man with a scar on his face?

[HEADER 005A0104]
A scar in the shape of a crescent moon?

[HEADER 005A0105]
Maybe... maybe not.

[HEADER 005A0106]
Tell me where I can find him and I'll leave you alone.

[HEADER 005A0107]
And if I don't?

[HEADER 005A0108]
I won't leave you alone.

[HEADER 005A0109]
I can't tell you anything unless you give me his name.

[HEADER 005A011F]
Thanks for nothing, Todryk.

[HEADER 00120000]
The policeman was not much older than me. His face wore an expression of intense concentration.

[HEADER 0012000D]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 0012000E]
Not so fast! I'd like your personal details, please.

[HEADER 0012000F]
Huh? What for?

[HEADER 00120010]
In the event of an accident.

[HEADER 00120011]
It would help us to know where to send the body.

[HEADER 00120003]
Hi there.

[HEADER 00120005]
Ah! M'sieur Hardy, non?

[HEADER 00120006]
Stobbart. George Stobbart.

[HEADER 00120004]
Bonjour.

[HEADER 00120012]
Look - is this really necessary? I came in here to talk to Rosso.

[HEADER 00120013]
Ah! Why did you not say!

[HEADER 0012002A]
He's not here.

[HEADER 0012002B]
But...

[HEADER 0012002C]
Do you wish to leave a message for him?

[HEADER 0012002D]
I have a choice of blue or black pens.

[HEADER 0012002E]
I'd recommend the blue for a less formal communication.

[HEADER 0012002F]
I'd prefer to talk to him in person.

[HEADER 00120030]
As you wish, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00120014]
Is Sergeant Moue available?

[HEADER 00120015]
What? You want to speak to him?

[HEADER 00120016]
Yes, please.

[HEADER 00120017]
I cannot recall the last time someone asked to speak to Moue.

[HEADER 00120018]
No-one ever speaks to him, not even his kids.

[HEADER 00120019]
Eh bien - he is not here, m'sieur. He is with Inspecteur Rosso.

[HEADER 0012001A]
Like Laurel and Keaton, non, m'sieur...?

[HEADER 0012001B]
Hardy. Oliver Norville Hardy.

[HEADER 0012007C]
Take a look at this...

[HEADER 0012007D]
Inspector Rosso's personal card!

[HEADER 0012007E]
Where did you get this?

[HEADER 0012007F]
He gave it to me.

[HEADER 00120080]
Why?

[HEADER 00120081]
I think he was impressed with my powers of observation.

[HEADER 00120082]
He asked me to contact him if I had any information...

[HEADER 00120083]
I see. You are a grass.

[HEADER 00120084]
Did I show you Rosso's card?

[HEADER 00120085]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 00120046]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 00120047]
It's a juggler's ball.

[HEADER 00120048]
Have you heard of a guy named Moerlin?

[HEADER 00120049]
No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0012004A]
Are you familiar with the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 0012004B]
No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0012004C]
Do you know what this powder is?

[HEADER 0012004D]
It looks like plaster, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0012004E]
Do you know what this device is used for?

[HEADER 0012004F]
Certainly, m'sieur. It is for measuring the pressure of the blood.

[HEADER 00120050]
This tripod is over five hundred years old...

[HEADER 00120051]
Remarkable, m'sieur, but hardly police business.

[HEADER 00120052]
Can you tell me anything about this gem?

[HEADER 00120053]
Me? No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00120054]
What do you think this lens could be used for?

[HEADER 00120055]
Hard to say, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00120056]
Do you know anything about medieval communion cups?

[HEADER 00120057]
No, m'sieur. I was a duffer at school when it came to history.

[HEADER 00120058]
I found this scrap of material in the sewer...

[HEADER 00120059]
Vraiment?

[HEADER 0012005A]
It was probably torn from the clothes of a psychotic killer.

[HEADER 0012005B]
Even if you were Sherlock Holmes, I would have trouble believing you.

[HEADER 0012005C]
I'd like to shake you by the hand....

[HEADER 0012005D]
Do you want to be arrested for assaulting a policeman?

[HEADER 0012005E]
Huh?

[HEADER 0012005F]
I noticed the Shake n' Shock buzzer concealed in your hand.

[HEADER 00120060]
Have you any idea what this tool is used for?

[HEADER 00120061]
Oui, m'sieur. It's a dipstick.

[HEADER 00120062]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00120063]
Non, m'sieur, I do not. I have no memory for faces.

[HEADER 00120066]
I found this tissue.

[HEADER 00120067]
Aie! What the hell is that?

[HEADER 00120068]
It's evidence.

[HEADER 00120069]
Evidence of what? Mayonnaise smuggling?

[HEADER 0012006A]
The sticky stuff is greasepaint.

[HEADER 0012006B]
Ah. And that is supposed to make me happy, is it?

[HEADER 0012006C]
I suggest you think long and hard about what you are doing with your life, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0012006D]
Don't you want this tissue?

[HEADER 0012006E]
No, I do not.

[HEADER 0012006F]
I found this red nose near the café de la Chandelle Verte.

[HEADER 00120070]
A clown's nose?

[HEADER 00120071]
That's right.

[HEADER 00120072]
The guy who wore this is a savage killer.

[HEADER 00120073]
If you say so, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00120074]
Don't you want to look at this nose?

[HEADER 00120075]
Not particularly, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00120076]
What do you make of this newspaper?

[HEADER 0012007B]
Nothing.

[HEADER 00120045]
Thanks for your help, officer.

[HEADER 00810000]
There's a guy with a sword and a bull.

[HEADER 00810001]
The only mythological bull I know of is the minotaur, but he was only half bull.

[HEADER 00810002]
I don't think I'd like to be half a bull, even if it was the bottom half.

[HEADER 00810003]
What's that object between them?

[HEADER 00810004]
It looks like a gem on top of a tripod.

[HEADER 00810005]
Between them is a gem, supported by a tripod...

[HEADER 00810007]
There's a guy working on a loom.

[HEADER 00810008]
He's weaving a carpet, or a tapestry.

[HEADER 00810009]
Or a duvet cover.

[HEADER 0081000A]
It's a clue to a place, I reckon.

[HEADER 0081000B]
Somewhere famed for weaving, and ships...

[HEADER 0081000C]
Where folk live in barrels?

[HEADER 0081000D]
It beats cardboard boxes...

[HEADER 00810010]
A knight with a crystal ball...

[HEADER 00810011]
There's something written on the scroll beside the knight.

[HEADER 00810012]
Yes, but it's written in Latin.

[HEADER 00810013]
`Per Disciplinum mea, lux videbis.'

[HEADER 00810014]
`By my... teachings, you will see the light.'

[HEADER 00810015]
You speak Latin? Where did you learn a trick like that?

[HEADER 00810016]
A trick? I studied law, okay? I can read Latin.

[HEADER 00810017]
My, you're touchy. Tell me that again...

[HEADER 00810018]
The knight's scroll bears a phrase in Latin...

[HEADER 00810019]
`Through my teachings, you will be enlightened.'

[HEADER 0081001C]
There's a woman looking at her reflection in a mirror...

[HEADER 0081001D]
...but the reflection has three hideous faces.

[HEADER 0081001E]
She reminds me of the wicked queen in Snow White...

[HEADER 0081001F]
She was the one who said: `Mirror, mirror, on the wall,' wasn't she?

[HEADER 00810020]
She made me cry so much when I was a kid, mom carried me out of the movie theatre.

[HEADER 00810021]
She didn't frighten me in the least.

[HEADER 00810022]
Like I said, I was only a kid. I didn't like the crocodile in Peter Pan, either.

[HEADER 0081016C]
Look there! Two guys on the same horse!

[HEADER 0081026C]
Let's face it - we need help, George.

[HEADER 0081026D]
Someone who knows about these things...

[HEADER 0081026E]
Who do you suggest - Indiana Jones?

[HEADER 0081026F]
I know a guy who specializes in medieval studies.

[HEADER 00810270]
His name is Lobineau.

[HEADER 00810271]
Huh! Some stuffy old fossil who gets horny over ancient relics, I suppose.

[HEADER 00810272]
Far from it. André isn't the stereotypical professor you have in mind.

[HEADER 00810273]
Where can I find this Lobineau guy?

[HEADER 00810274]
At the Crune museum. I'll give you the address.

[HEADER 0081018F]
Hi. How are you?

[HEADER 00810190]
Oh, hi. Come in, George.

[HEADER 00810293]
What are you doing to help trace the killer clown?

[HEADER 00810294]
Research, George.

[HEADER 00810295]
Yeah? You have a copy of the Clowns' Yearbook?

[HEADER 00810296]
I have a telephone and a lot of contacts.

[HEADER 00810297]
Oh. Well, did you find anything useful?

[HEADER 00810298]
Not yet. I'm employing my first and most useful weapon...

[HEADER 00810299]
What's that?

[HEADER 0081029A]
Patience.

[HEADER 0081029B]
I've heard of that. Isn't it a substitute for decisive thinking?

[HEADER 00810224]
Do you have a boyfriend?

[HEADER 00810226]
Not any more...

[HEADER 00810227]
There was someone - a guy in my final year - but it didn't work out.

[HEADER 00810228]
Neither did my degree.

[HEADER 00810229]
I'm sorry...

[HEADER 0081022A]
I'm not.

[HEADER 0081022B]
Tell me more about your family...

[HEADER 0081022C]
When I was a little girl, I used to spend the winter with my grandfather and grandma.

[HEADER 0081022D]
They were the best times, warm and safe in their tiny cottage...

[HEADER 0081022E]
My grandfather rolled cigarettes while grandma made hot chocolate and cakes.

[HEADER 0081022F]
One day he stopped his rolling, put the lid back on his tobacco jar, and took me in his arms.

[HEADER 00810230]
I laughed and wriggled, but he hushed me to be silent.

[HEADER 00810231]
With his unshaven chin all scratchy in my ear, he told me his secret...

[HEADER 00810232]
What did he say?

[HEADER 00810233]
He said: 'I don't smoke, but she likes to think I do.'

[HEADER 00810234]
What a weird old man!

[HEADER 00810235]
Don't call my grandfather weird! He was the nicest guy ever!

[HEADER 00810236]
I wish I was back in that cottage, instead of this crummy apartment in this noisy city...

[HEADER 00810166]
You're just not going to believe what I've found!

[HEADER 00810167]
It's not another part of the clown's costume, is it?

[HEADER 00810168]
It's a medieval manuscript.

[HEADER 00810169]
Khan left it in the safe at the Ubu.

[HEADER 00001E29]
He'd checked in under the name Thomas Moerlin.

[HEADER 0081016A]
It's incredible! Is this what he took from Plantard?

[HEADER 0081016B]
It could be, which means it's worth enough to kill for...

[HEADER 0081016D]
Yeah. Maybe they couldn't afford one each.

[HEADER 0081016E]
What of it?

[HEADER 0081016F]
Have you ever heard of the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 00810170]
Their official seal was an image of two knights, sharing a horse!

[HEADER 00810171]
Whatever this manuscript means, it's connected with the Templars.

[HEADER 00810172]
How come you know about these Knights?

[HEADER 00810173]
I learned about them while writing an article on the Crusades.

[HEADER 00810186]
Jeez! So the treasure is hidden, waiting to be discovered?

[HEADER 00810187]
If there ever was a treasure, it's been lost for six hundred years.

[HEADER 00810188]
Anyway, we're supposed to be investigating a serial killer, not a medieval treasure trove...

[HEADER 00810189]
But maybe that's what the clown and his accomplices are after.

[HEADER 0081018A]
Maybe this manuscript is the key!

[HEADER 0081018B]
You'd better leave it here for safe keeping.

[HEADER 00810275]
Let's take another look at the manuscript...

[HEADER 0081032A]
I found this in the killer's room...

[HEADER 0081032B]
What is it? A credit card?

[HEADER 0081032C]
I.D. Thomas Moerlin, of the Grüber Electronics Corporation.

[HEADER 0081032D]
Never heard of him, or the company.

[HEADER 0081032E]
Are you sure you've never heard of Thomas Moerlin?

[HEADER 0081032F]
Positive.

[HEADER 00810338]
I found this matchbook in the killer's hotel room...

[HEADER 00810339]
It's from the Club Alamut...

[HEADER 0081033A]
Never heard of it. Is there anything written inside it?

[HEADER 0081033B]
No. What were you expecting?

[HEADER 0081033C]
If this was a movie there'd be a clue - a name or an address...

[HEADER 0081033D]
That's no use - there aren't even any matches in it.

[HEADER 0081033E]
Oh, well. I'll keep it as a souvenir.

[HEADER 0081033F]
Did I show you this matchbook?

[HEADER 00810340]
Huh? Oh, yeah.

[HEADER 008102CE]
Okay. Don't forget to look for Lobineau at the Crune Museum.

[HEADER 00810148]
Hi. I've been to the Crune Museum.

[HEADER 00810149]
Did you speak to Lobineau?

[HEADER 0081014A]
No - he wasn't there.

[HEADER 0081029C]
Have you found out any more about the murders?

[HEADER 0081029D]
Well, it may be nothing, but both the clown's victims visited Paris earlier this year...

[HEADER 0081029E]
When?

[HEADER 0081029F]
The second week of July. They were both here at the same time.

[HEADER 008102A0]
Did they meet?

[HEADER 008102A1]
I don't know, but I can't imagine it was coincidence.

[HEADER 0081014B]
I've found the tripod!

[HEADER 0081014F]
Where?

[HEADER 00810150]
In the museum. It belonged to the Templars.

[HEADER 00810151]
It was dug up in Ireland at a place called Lochmarne...

[HEADER 00810152]
I've heard of Lochmarne!

[HEADER 00810153]
I read an article about the castle. Take a look for yourself.

[HEADER 00810154]
A popular gossip magazine! You read that rubbish?

[HEADER 00810155]
No, I write it.

[HEADER 00810156]
Professor Nigel Peagram... excavating the medieval castle at Lochmarne...

[HEADER 00810157]
That's strange.

[HEADER 00810158]
What?

[HEADER 00810159]
He resigned his chair at Durham University in order to devote his time to the excavation.

[HEADER 0081015A]
Not only that, but he cancelled the filming of a fourth series of his popular television program!

[HEADER 0081015B]
This site at Lochmarne must be awful important to him!

[HEADER 0081015C]
He's a professor of history. They're all cuckoo.

[HEADER 0081015D]
All the same, I'd like to talk to this Professor Peagram...

[HEADER 0081015E]
How do you feel about a trip to Ireland?

[HEADER 0081015F]
Disappointed...

[HEADER 00810160]
Huh?

[HEADER 00810161]
...that I won't be going.

[HEADER 00810162]
I want to follow up the Bilotta case.

[HEADER 00810163]
If you really think Peagram's gem is important, why don't you visit Lochmarne?

[HEADER 00810164]
On my own? I'm not so sure about that...

[HEADER 00810165]
Where is Ireland, exactly?

[HEADER 00120001]
It was Rosso's sidekick: Sergeant Moue.

[HEADER 00910001]
Excuse me, sergeant...

[HEADER 00910011]
What do you want now?

[HEADER 00910002]
Sergeant Moue?

[HEADER 0091000C]
Ah! Monsieur Stobbart, n'est-ce pas?

[HEADER 0091000D]
That's correct. You remember me!

[HEADER 0091000E]
The retention of such data is part of my duty as a gendarme.

[HEADER 0091000F]
That is how crime is fought; through attention to detail, not intuition.

[HEADER 00910010]
Yeah, sure.

[HEADER 00910068]
Do you know a man named Khan?

[HEADER 00001966]
He's a shifty looking guy with a scar on his right cheek.

[HEADER 0091006A]
No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0091006B]
He also calls himself Thomas Moerlin.

[HEADER 0091006C]
I'm sorry, m'sieur Stobbart - I don't know him.

[HEADER 0091006D]
Has this man any connection with the bombing of the café?

[HEADER 0091006E]
Yes. I believe Khan was the name he used when he hired the clown costume.

[HEADER 0091004B]
Is Rosso here?

[HEADER 0091004C]
Yes, he is. You wish to speak to him?

[HEADER 0091004D]
Yes, I do.

[HEADER 0091004E]
One moment, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910053]
It's Stobbart, m'sieur. He insists on talking to you again.

[HEADER 00910056]
Did he say what it was about?

[HEADER 00910057]
No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910058]
Very well.

[HEADER 00850001]
Hi, Inspector - remember me?

[HEADER 00850002]
But of course, Docteur! My mind is a well-ordered faculty.

[HEADER 00850003]
But of course, Mister Stobbart! My mind is a well-ordered faculty.

[HEADER 00850004]
A mental classification system that's the envy of the Bibliotheque Nationale.

[HEADER 00850005]
No tricks, mark you m'sieur, just exercise.

[HEADER 00850006]
Just as our muscles waste through inactivity, so our minds decay...

[HEADER 00850007]
But there is no need, if only people would learn to exercise their wits daily!

[HEADER 00850008]
If he was trying to impress me, it worked.

[HEADER 00850009]
He was pompous and patronizing, but he had style.

[HEADER 0085000A]
Eh bien, if you've called about the bombing, you're too late.

[HEADER 0085000B]
Investigations have been closed.

[HEADER 0085000C]
But...

[HEADER 0085000D]
I've been taken off the case.

[HEADER 0085000E]
What about the murder? The dead guy?

[HEADER 0085000F]
It is out of my hands.

[HEADER 00850030]
Don't you want to know what I found out about the killer?

[HEADER 00850031]
I told you, m'sieur - the case is closed.

[HEADER 00850032]
I have washed my hands of the whole affair.

[HEADER 00850033]
Then I'll have to continue my investigations without your help...

[HEADER 00850034]
No! You must forget the business of the clown completely.

[HEADER 00850035]
Go back to being an ordinary tourist, Stobbart.

[HEADER 00850024]
Did you find out the I.D. of the guy who was killed in the explosion?

[HEADER 00850025]
I already knew who he was.

[HEADER 00850026]
I heard that the bomb victim's name was Plantard.

[HEADER 00850027]
Your sources are reliable.

[HEADER 00850028]
He was a big shot in the Treasury, wasn't he?

[HEADER 00850029]
Maybe that's why you've been taken off the case...

[HEADER 0085002A]
I'm sorry, m'sieur. I cannot comment.

[HEADER 0085002B]
Do you know a pair of thugs called Flap and Guido?

[HEADER 0085002C]
I have known those two since they graduated from special school.

[HEADER 0085002D]
Flap is a nasty piece of work, but Guido is the real brains of the partnership.

[HEADER 0085002E]
Where did you hear of them?

[HEADER 0085002F]
I met them out front of the Hôtel Ubu.

[HEADER 00850036]
Have you heard of Dr Peagram, the archaeologist?

[HEADER 00850037]
Molly Peagram? The second son of Lord Barclay-Peagram?

[HEADER 00850038]
I don't know. I read about him in a magazine.

[HEADER 00850039]
So much for the efficacy of rehabilitation!

[HEADER 0085003A]
What has he done this time?

[HEADER 0085003B]
He made an important archaeological find in Ireland.

[HEADER 0085003C]
Do you know Peagram well?

[HEADER 0085003D]
I have connections with the family, but I wouldn't say I knew him at all.

[HEADER 0085003E]
Is his name really Molly?

[HEADER 0085003F]
Of course not! That was the nickname he was given at school.

[HEADER 00850040]
All his friends and acquaintances know him as Molly.

[HEADER 00850041]
Have you heard of the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 00850042]
Les Templiers? But of course, m'sieur!

[HEADER 00850043]
Their fame is widespread throughout France!

[HEADER 00850044]
We haven't forgotten them, unlike the rest of Europe.

[HEADER 00850045]
It was the king of France who persecuted them, though.

[HEADER 00850046]
Indeed.

[HEADER 00850047]
That shook his cool. Underneath his cultured facade the man was real twitchy.

[HEADER 00850048]
You're obviously a great admirer of the Knights Templar...

[HEADER 00850049]
They were men of great honour, m'sieur. The flower of Chivalry.

[HEADER 0085004A]
Not everyone would share your views, Inspector.

[HEADER 0085004B]
Not everyone shares my passion for Bartok!

[HEADER 0085004C]
But if the Templars were as honourable as...

[HEADER 0085004D]
That's enough! I do not wish to hear your uninformed opinions, Stobbart.

[HEADER 0085004E]
Why do you get so wound up about the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 0085004F]
They've been dead for centuries!

[HEADER 00850050]
I shouldn't have pushed my luck. Maybe his ancestors were Templars.

[HEADER 00850051]
Whatever, I saw the anger flare in his eyes like a distant summer thunderstorm.

[HEADER 00850052]
The Templars were the first true Internationalists!

[HEADER 00850053]
Eight hundred years on, and still the world is fragmented by nationalistic, flag-waving fools!

[HEADER 00850054]
You will excuse me.

[HEADER 0085006B]
Would you like to see the gem again?

[HEADER 0085006C]
No, thank you.

[HEADER 00850066]
What do you make of this, Inspector?

[HEADER 00850067]
Astounding! Where did you come by a stone like that?

[HEADER 00850068]
I was given it by a man in a bar in Ireland.

[HEADER 00850069]
Do you recognize the gem?

[HEADER 0085006A]
It is unfamiliar to me. If such a jewel had been stolen, I would know it for sure.

[HEADER 00850077]
Did I show you this photograph?

[HEADER 00850078]
Oui. You're still convinced he is the killer?

[HEADER 00850079]
Absolutely.

[HEADER 00850070]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 00850071]
Non.

[HEADER 00850072]
It's the face of a killer.

[HEADER 00850073]
The man who bombed the café?

[HEADER 00850074]
The photograph was taken soon after the explosion.

[HEADER 00850075]
He'd escaped through the sewers, leaving a trail of clues behind him.

[HEADER 00850076]
Circumstantial evidence, Stobbart. None of it proves a thing.

[HEADER 00850082]
Does the name Thomas Moerlin mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00850087]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00850083]
Non, m'sieur, nothing.

[HEADER 00850084]
It's another one of the assumed names used by the killer.

[HEADER 00850085]
Ah! The famous killer clown case...

[HEADER 00850086]
Yeah. You might have forgotten all about it, but I still aim to find that guy.

[HEADER 0085008A]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00850091]
You already asked me that. I told you - non.

[HEADER 0085008B]
Non, m'sieur. I suggest you ask Sergeant Moue about that.

[HEADER 0085008C]
I did. He recognized it immediately.

[HEADER 0085008D]
Was his information useful to you?

[HEADER 0085008E]
No, not at all.

[HEADER 0085008F]
God only knows why, but he collects matchbooks.

[HEADER 00850090]
He claims it is a hobby.

[HEADER 0085006D]
Does this red nose mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0085006E]
I'd imagine it means you have not given up your pursuit of the clown?

[HEADER 0085006F]
You're absolutely right.

[HEADER 0085007A]
What do you make of this white powder, Rosso?

[HEADER 0085007B]
It is plaster.

[HEADER 0085007C]
Say - you're good.

[HEADER 0085007D]
What do you make of this, Rosso?

[HEADER 0085007E]
It is a tool for gaining access to sewers.

[HEADER 0085007F]
Would you care to shake my hand, Inspector?

[HEADER 00850080]
Please don't be offended if I decline your offer, Stobbart.

[HEADER 00850081]
The palms of my hands are particularly sensitive.

[HEADER 00850088]
I found this tissue in the sewer...

[HEADER 00850089]
It would have been best if you'd left it there.

[HEADER 0085005A]
So long, Inspector.

[HEADER 00910059]
Not really.

[HEADER 00910022]
I was one of the last people to see the victim alive, sergeant.

[HEADER 00910023]
Does that worry you?

[HEADER 00910024]
Yes, it does. I feel I kinda... owe it to him, to find his killer.

[HEADER 00910025]
That is best left to the authorities, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910026]
Did he speak to you, tell you anything?

[HEADER 00910027]
No. He just grinned and nodded.

[HEADER 00910028]
Don't let it trouble you, m'sieur. Go home and try to forget.

[HEADER 00910029]
I know the identity of the dead guy! His name was Plantard.

[HEADER 0091002A]
Is that so? You knew him, did you?

[HEADER 0091002B]
No - but...

[HEADER 0091002C]
We'll know everything there is to know about him, soon enough.

[HEADER 0091002D]
I'm trying to be helpful here!

[HEADER 0091002E]
The best way you can help us is to go home, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0091002F]
I have a confession to make, Sergeant.

[HEADER 00910030]
I really did see the clown.

[HEADER 00910031]
He ran into the alley across the street.

[HEADER 00910032]
Why did you not tell this to Inspecteur Rosso?

[HEADER 00910033]
I didn't want to sound foolish...

[HEADER 00910034]
And you did not want to become involved, no?

[HEADER 00910035]
Do not worry. It is of no consequence.

[HEADER 00910037]
Did you follow him?

[HEADER 00910038]
I lost him. I figure he went under ground.

[HEADER 00910039]
Do you know how many kilometres of sewers there are beneath this great city?

[HEADER 0091003A]
It's not a question I've lost sleep over...

[HEADER 0091003B]
I have no doubt that Inspecteur Rosso will organize a proper search.

[HEADER 00910082]
What are you going to do about Flap and Guido, Sergeant?

[HEADER 00910083]
I'm going to bust them, m'sieur!

[HEADER 00910084]
For years I've been hoping to pin something on that pair.

[HEADER 00910085]
Now's my chance. I'll show them, and the Inspecteur!

[HEADER 00910086]
Thanks, Sergeant. Thanks for taking me seriously.

[HEADER 00910087]
I'm only doing my duty, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910078]
I'd like to report an assault.

[HEADER 00910079]
Yes, m'sieur? Where is the victim?

[HEADER 0091007A]
I'm the victim! I've been harassed by a pair of thugs.

[HEADER 0091007B]
I see! And where did this alleged assault take place?

[HEADER 0091007C]
Outside the Hotel Ubu.

[HEADER 0091007D]
They stopped me as I was leaving and went through my pockets.

[HEADER 0091007E]
Could you describe the suspects, m'sieur?

[HEADER 0091007F]
One looked like a gorilla, and the other like a weasel.

[HEADER 00910080]
Their names are Flap and Guido.

[HEADER 00910081]
Bon! I'll get them this time...

[HEADER 009100BD]
Are you sure you don't want this false nose?

[HEADER 009100BE]
Don't try my patience, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100B5]
I found this red nose in the sewer.

[HEADER 009100B6]
What were you doing down there?

[HEADER 009100B7]
Fishing for clues. That's where the clown went.

[HEADER 009100B8]
You still insist you saw a clown, m'sieur?

[HEADER 009100B9]
Of course - and this novelty nose proves it!

[HEADER 009100BA]
It will take more than a plastic proboscis to convince Inspecteur Rosso!

[HEADER 009100BB]
You don't want this as evidence, then?

[HEADER 009100BC]
Certainly not, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009100C6]
I've got Inspector Rosso's address card...

[HEADER 009100C7]
Yes, m'sieur. You showed me before...

[HEADER 009100BF]
Look, sergeant - the Inspector gave me his card...

[HEADER 009100C0]
Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100C1]
He wants you to advise him if you have any information concerning this case.

[HEADER 009100C2]
I'd be glad to talk with him, but I don't want him working his psycho weirdness on me.

[HEADER 009100C3]
Ah, no, m'sieur. You are confusing the science of parapsychology with witchcraft.

[HEADER 009100C4]
Oh, yeah? What's the difference?

[HEADER 009100C5]
We don't do sacrifices.

[HEADER 009100D8]
Did I show you my tool, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100D9]
Yes, m'sieur - unfortunately you did.

[HEADER 009100CD]
What do you suppose this tool is used for, Sergeant Moue?

[HEADER 009100CE]
It looks like something an obstetrician would use, m'sieur...

[HEADER 009100CF]
It was with tools like this that the clown made his escape!

[HEADER 009100D0]
I don't understand...

[HEADER 009100D1]
He opened up the hole and disappeared into the bowels of the earth!

[HEADER 009100D2]
If you say so, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100D3]
I don't think so. I found it in that workman's toolbox.

[HEADER 009100D4]
Found it? I hope you did not steal it, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009100D5]
Do I look like a common thief?

[HEADER 009100D6]
He asked me to look after his hole, and his belongings.

[HEADER 009100D7]
You certainly know how to enjoy your vacation to the fullest, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100EC]
Do you recognize this dirty tissue?

[HEADER 009100F2]
I told you - no, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100ED]
No, m'sieur, I do not.

[HEADER 009100EE]
I found it in the sewer...

[HEADER 009100EF]
Perhaps It would be better if you put it back there...

[HEADER 009100F0]
No way! This could be an important clue.

[HEADER 009100F1]
If you say so, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100A5]
Did I show you this photograph, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100A6]
Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0091009D]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 0091009E]
No, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0091009F]
It's the guy who bombed the café - the clown.

[HEADER 009100A0]
This man looks nothing like a clown.

[HEADER 009100A1]
He's taken off his greasepaint and costume.

[HEADER 009100A2]
Then there is nothing to link this man with the killing.

[HEADER 009100A3]
Nothing? Look at those murderous eyes!

[HEADER 009100A4]
Hmm... hardly likely to get him convicted.

[HEADER 0091009B]
Would you like to keep this ball as evidence, Sergeant?

[HEADER 0091009C]
No, thank you.

[HEADER 00910092]
Look what I found, Sergeant Moue!

[HEADER 00910093]
It is a ball. The ball of a child.

[HEADER 00910094]
You're half right, but this is no toy, Sergeant Moue.

[HEADER 00910095]
Don't tell me.... the Juggler is back!

[HEADER 00910096]
The Juggler? Who's he?

[HEADER 00910097]
The most cunning circus performer turned pickpocket in Paris.

[HEADER 00910098]
He mesmerizes his audience with an unarguably talented but mind-numbing display of juggling...

[HEADER 00910099]
...while his accomplice goes through the crowd and empties their pockets.

[HEADER 0091009A]
I thought we'd seen the last of him!

[HEADER 009100DA]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100E2]
You already showed me, m'sieur. It's a beauty.

[HEADER 009100DB]
That's a double-lined Swedish with a cross-hatch Bergmann strike-strip.

[HEADER 009100DC]
Now, that's unusual. Pre-war Anderson hinging!

[HEADER 009100DD]
Really?

[HEADER 009100DE]
I haven't seen a reinforced Anderson outside of a private collection!

[HEADER 009100DF]
It's rare, then?

[HEADER 009100E0]
In this part of the world, yes.

[HEADER 009100E1]
There are only three places these are made: Tai-Wan, Manila, and Slough.

[HEADER 009100F3]
What do you think of this chalice, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100F4]
Hmm. Not much.

[HEADER 009100F5]
It's over six hundred years old!

[HEADER 009100F6]
It looks it. I wouldn't drink from that rusty old thing if I was you.

[HEADER 0091006F]
Have you ever heard of the Hashshashin, Sergeant?

[HEADER 00910070]
What was that?

[HEADER 00910071]
The Cult of the Assassins.

[HEADER 00910072]
What are you trying to say, Stobbart?

[HEADER 00910073]
That the clown is a member of that cult.

[HEADER 00910074]
I see. And what proof do you have?

[HEADER 00910075]
Proof? I arrived at my conclusion through logical deduction and...

[HEADER 00910076]
Pseudo-intellectual piffle!

[HEADER 00910077]
Leave the investigation of crime to those who know best - the Police!

[HEADER 009100F7]
Would you like to shake my hand, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100F8]
Not while I'm on duty, m'sieur. The gesture could be misconstrued.

[HEADER 00910091]
See you later, sergeant.

[HEADER 00910003]
Yes?

[HEADER 00910069]
He's a shifty looking guy with a scar on his left cheek.

[HEADER 00910088]
Have you heard of a man called Marquet?

[HEADER 00910089]
Yes. He used to be known as the Mole of Montmartre.

[HEADER 0091008A]
I heard he's been hospitalised - probably by one of his rivals.

[HEADER 0091008B]
Which hospital was Marquet taken to?

[HEADER 0091008C]
The Hagenmeyer Clinic, in the Avenue des Hérissons.

[HEADER 0091008D]
Why was Marquet known as the Mole of Montmartre?

[HEADER 0091008E]
Because he lived in Montmartre, I suppose.

[HEADER 0091008F]
Yes, but why the Mole?

[HEADER 00910090]
I don't know. Maybe he ruined people's lawns.

[HEADER 009100B3]
Did I show you this newspaper...?

[HEADER 009100B4]
Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100A7]
I found this in the street, Sergeant.

[HEADER 009100A8]
That, m'sieur, is a newspaper, no?

[HEADER 009100A9]
There's a note written on it - `Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty five.'

[HEADER 009100AE]
Ah - ha!

[HEADER 009100AF]
That's stumped you, hasn't it?

[HEADER 009100B0]
I have never been stumped - as you put it - in my life, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100B1]
It is the name assumed by the clown, no?

[HEADER 009100B2]
Salah-eh Dinn the clown...? I don't think so.

[HEADER 009100EA]
Did I show you this material, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100EB]
Yes, m'sieur. It is horrible.

[HEADER 009100E3]
I believe this material came from the clown's clothing.

[HEADER 009100E4]
If you are right, m'sieur, then the clown must be an Englishman.

[HEADER 009100E5]
How do you figure that?

[HEADER 009100E6]
Only the English would wear a suit made from material like that.

[HEADER 009100E7]
Don't you like the English?

[HEADER 009100E8]
It is not so much a question of liking, rather one of taste.

[HEADER 009100E9]
They have none.

[HEADER 00001C84]
I knew it was George.

[HEADER 00001C85]
For a moment I was tempted to pretend that I was out. Or ask him to go away and come back later. But then...

[HEADER 00001C86]
Come in...

[HEADER 00810129]
Hello, George.

[HEADER 0081012A]
So where did you stay last night?

[HEADER 0081012B]
At MacDevitts. I got to drinking with Doyle and a couple of the guys.

[HEADER 0081012C]
That explains why you look so ill today. Did you get any sleep at all?

[HEADER 0081012D]
Not much. I had to share the room with another guy.

[HEADER 0081012E]
Did he snore?

[HEADER 0081012F]
Hardly - he was dead.

[HEADER 00810130]
Then Leary woke me in the middle of the night to help bail out the cellar.

[HEADER 00810131]
The cellar was flooded?

[HEADER 00810132]
Yeah. Some idiot had left the faucet running...

[HEADER 00810133]
And you say Peagram has disappeared?

[HEADER 00810134]
Without a trace. But my visit wasn't a complete waste of time...

[HEADER 00810135]
Peagram's gem!

[HEADER 00810136]
The Templars' gem.

[HEADER 00810137]
Whoever Jacques Marquet is, he's in for a disappointment.

[HEADER 00810138]
Jacques Marquet?

[HEADER 00810139]
He's the guy who should have collected the gem from Fitzgerald.

[HEADER 00810142]
What are your plans?

[HEADER 00810143]
I want to find out who, what, or where Montfauçon was.

[HEADER 00810144]
All I've got to go by is the name and a picture of a hanged man...

[HEADER 00810383]
Look, Nico - a handful of plaster.

[HEADER 00810384]
Yeah. Why is it that men never really grow up?

[HEADER 00810385]
What's your problem, sister?

[HEADER 00810386]
Your pockets. Stuffed with useless junk, like a little boy's...

[HEADER 00810387]
You never know when useless junk might come in handy.

[HEADER 00810388]
Yeah - you showed me.

[HEADER 00810328]
Do you want to look after the gem?

[HEADER 00810329]
No, George. I'd be too tempted to sell it.

[HEADER 00810326]
Do you want this photograph back?

[HEADER 00810327]
No, you keep it. I can always make another print.

[HEADER 008102CD]
I can't sit here all day, much as I'd like to...

[HEADER 008102CF]
And why don't you see if Rosso has heard anything?

[HEADER 008102D0]
Okay. Anything else I can do for you while I'm out?

[HEADER 008102D1]
Shopping? A trip to the laundromat?

[HEADER 008102D2]
Just take care of yourself.

[HEADER 00001C87]
I so much wanted to talk to George about everything that had happened.  But I knew I never could.

[HEADER 00001C88]
My father's connection to Africa would have to remain a secret for ever.

[HEADER 00000D07]
His bravery would be known only to the government - and to me.

[HEADER 00001C89]
Revealing it would just damage his memory.  People would take the story - and twist it.

[HEADER 00001C8A]
Before long, he would be the villain and Carchon would be the hero.

[HEADER 00000D08]
I know how they do that.  I'm a journalist.

[HEADER 00810069]
George! Welcome back!

[HEADER 0081006A]
Come in, George. It's good to see you again.

[HEADER 0081006B]
Is it?

[HEADER 0081006C]
Sure! What did you find in Spain?

[HEADER 0081006D]
Without André we wouldn't have got this far, George.

[HEADER 0081006E]
Yeah, I know.

[HEADER 0081006F]
The clues led to an underground chamber at the bottom of a well.

[HEADER 00810070]
The Templars had left a tapestry, showing a chess board.

[HEADER 00810071]
The white pieces were vastly outnumbered.

[HEADER 00810072]
There was a stream running across the board, and a Templar knight on a horse.

[HEADER 00810073]
Does it mean anything to you, André?

[HEADER 00810074]
No... nothing.

[HEADER 00810075]
Maybe we should tell André what else you found, George.

[HEADER 00810076]
There's a map and a Latin inscription...

[HEADER 00810077]
`To the West, at the edge of the world'.

[HEADER 00810078]
George found that in a cave in Syria.

[HEADER 00810079]
Yeah, where the Assassin almost killed me.

[HEADER 0081007A]
Then we've got the burning of Jacques de Molay, and the date: Thirteen-fourteen.

[HEADER 0081007B]
From the window of the church in Montfauçon Square.

[HEADER 0081007C]
One of the few places where nobody tried to kill me.

[HEADER 0081007D]
Then we have the image of a church that George found at the excavation.

[HEADER 0081007E]
I don't recall anyone trying to kill you there either, George.

[HEADER 0081007F]
And finally we have the tapestry in Spain.

[HEADER 00810080]
Did I mention I almost got killed there?

[HEADER 00810081]
Not yet, but I'm sure you're about to...

[HEADER 00810082]
It was only my cat-like reflexes that saved me from certain death!

[HEADER 00810083]
Cat-like reflexes, eh?

[HEADER 00810084]
And while I was risking life and limb where were you, André?

[HEADER 00810085]
Getting your glasses fogged up over an Etruscan vase?

[HEADER 00810086]
That's enough, boys. Can we get back to saving the world?

[HEADER 00810087]
Of course. My apologies.

[HEADER 00810088]
He started it.

[HEADER 00810089]
Well, the Latin phrase are the words of Julius Caesar.

[HEADER 0081008A]
He was describing the Island of Britain.

[HEADER 0081008B]
Are you sure? The map didn't look much like Britain...

[HEADER 0081008C]
How come Caesar described Britain as being at the edge of the world?

[HEADER 0081008D]
To the Romans, the Mediterranean was the centre of the universe.

[HEADER 0081008E]
Britain was a remote, unfriendly place, inhabited by blue-painted savages.

[HEADER 0081008F]
It hasn't changed much...

[HEADER 00810090]
They've stopped painting themselves blue.

[HEADER 00810091]
Except when they go to a football match...

[HEADER 00810092]
They used an extract from a plant called woad - Isatis Tinctoia.

[HEADER 00810093]
The Scots were using it until fairly recently in their wars with the English.

[HEADER 00810094]
Fairly recently? I don't recall the Scots being at war with the English!

[HEADER 00810095]
How recently are you talking about?

[HEADER 00810096]
I believe William Wallace's men used it in the thirteenth century.

[HEADER 00810097]
They might well have been using it as late as...

[HEADER 00810098]
You can't remember, can you?

[HEADER 00810099]
...Thirteen-fourteen!

[HEADER 0081009A]
Oh, we're back onto that, are we?

[HEADER 0081009B]
André, what is it? What do you mean?

[HEADER 0081009C]
Thirteen-fourteen. In Scotland.

[HEADER 0081009D]
The Battle of Bannockburn!

[HEADER 0081009E]
That would explain the stream on the chess board!

[HEADER 0081009F]
That's what a `burn' is! Right, André? As in `Bannockburn'?

[HEADER 008100A0]
Right, George. And it gets better...

[HEADER 008100A1]
Tradition has it that the Scots were helped by a shock force of... well, can't you guess?

[HEADER 008100A2]
Knights Templar?

[HEADER 008100A3]
Yes, a group of outlawed Templars.

[HEADER 008100A4]
They are said to have turned the tide for the Scots.

[HEADER 008100A5]
And it all ends at a church.

[HEADER 008100A6]
In the Isle of Britain, at Bannockburn, in a church.

[HEADER 008100A7]
What are we waiting for?

[HEADER 008100A8]
I'll call a cab.

[HEADER 008100A9]
I can't go.

[HEADER 008100AA]
André - you've been loads of help, but...

[HEADER 008100AB]
What George is trying to say, is that you shouldn't feel guilty.

[HEADER 008100AC]
I was...?

[HEADER 008100AD]
We understand - you've got commitments.

[HEADER 008100AE]
Listen - we have to hurry. Let's go, George...

[HEADER 008100AF]
We'll see it through. Oh, and - don't worry about us.

[HEADER 008100B2]
I've found out what the chalice was for...!

[HEADER 008100B3]
You've solved the puzzle?

[HEADER 008100B4]
Yeah. There was a distorted picture at the Baphomet site.

[HEADER 008100B5]
When I viewed it in the polished surface of the chalice, it changed.

[HEADER 008100B6]
What did it show?

[HEADER 008100B7]
A picture of a church with a square tower...

[HEADER 00810031]
I solved another puzzle!

[HEADER 00810032]
You did?

[HEADER 00810033]
Well - I guess I did.

[HEADER 00810034]
Well, what was it? What's the answer?

[HEADER 00810035]
Thirteen-fourteen.

[HEADER 00810036]
What does that mean?

[HEADER 00810037]
It was the date when Jacques de Molay was burned, wasn't it?

[HEADER 00810038]
Of course!

[HEADER 00810039]
The answer was hidden in a stained glass window.

[HEADER 0081003A]
When I looked through the lens, the picture changed...

[HEADER 0081003B]
It became a man surrounded by flames.

[HEADER 0081003C]
It seems to me the answers to the Templar puzzles are as cryptic as the clues...

[HEADER 0081003D]
Sometimes I wonder if the manuscript isn't an elaborate joke.

[HEADER 0081003E]
The Knights Templar weren't the kind of people to play jokes, were they?

[HEADER 008100C7]
Nico! I've seen them!

[HEADER 008100C8]
Who?

[HEADER 008100C9]
The Templars! I spied on their meeting in the catacombs!

[HEADER 008100CA]
And you saw the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 008100CB]
I saw a bunch of guys masquerading as Templars.

[HEADER 008100CC]
They're after something called the Sword of Baphomet.

[HEADER 008100CD]
The bogus doctor was there - the guy who killed Marquet.

[HEADER 008100CE]
The manuscript is the key, just as we thought.

[HEADER 008100CF]
It shows the way to the Broken Sword - whatever that is...

[HEADER 008100D0]
And how does the Assassin fit into all this?

[HEADER 008100D1]
He's out to stop them!

[HEADER 008100D2]
These neo-Templars - they're men and women in influential positions.

[HEADER 008100D3]
Don't you see? Plantard was one of them!

[HEADER 008100D4]
The Assassin killed him for the manuscript, to stop them finding the Sword.

[HEADER 008100D5]
But now we've got the manuscript!

[HEADER 008100D6]
Yeah.

[HEADER 008100D7]
So how do they hope to find the Sword?

[HEADER 008100D8]
I don't know.

[HEADER 008100D9]
They said something about a lens, and a guy called Klausner who's gone to Syria.

[HEADER 008100DA]
But they didn't seem to realize the significance of the very site of their meeting!

[HEADER 008100DB]
You see, after they'd gone, I discovered a stone pedestal and a carved inscription.

[HEADER 008100DC]
I set up the gem on the tripod, directly below a beam of light.

[HEADER 008100DD]
The gem split the beam, and lit the letters M-A-R-I-B.

[HEADER 008100DE]
Marib is a village in Syria.

[HEADER 008100DF]
Then the Neo-Templars are ahead of us. Klausner beat me to it.

[HEADER 008100E0]
You're not thinking of going there yourself, are you?

[HEADER 008100E1]
Why not?

[HEADER 008100E2]
These guys are crazy - and dangerous.

[HEADER 008100E3]
That reminds me - you should leave the gem here.

[HEADER 008100E4]
Okay. What about the tripod?

[HEADER 008100E5]
I'll send it back to André - anonymously...

[HEADER 0081004A]
...luckily, the canopy on Ultar's truck broke my fall.

[HEADER 0081004B]
Thank goodness for that.

[HEADER 0081004C]
The worst part of the experience was Ultar's driving.

[HEADER 0081004D]
What about the lens? Is it still in one piece?

[HEADER 0081004E]
Oh, yes.

[HEADER 0081004F]
Well, it's good to see you again, George.

[HEADER 00810050]
Really? I must say, I'd have enjoyed Syria a lot more if you'd been there...

[HEADER 00810051]
I wouldn't have been much help. Anyway - you did just fine on your own.

[HEADER 0081005B]
So the curse of the de Vasconcellos is lifted...

[HEADER 0081005C]
Oh, no. The Countess was thrilled to find the lost chalice...

[HEADER 0081005D]
...but there's still the riddle of the missing knight.

[HEADER 0081005E]
Well, you can forget about that now and get back to finding the Templar's secret.

[HEADER 0081005F]
Uh... actually, I promised the Countess I'd find Don Carlos.

[HEADER 00810060]
You what?

[HEADER 00810061]
I can explain everything...

[HEADER 00810062]
You've got the hots for a withered old Spanish aristocrat...!

[HEADER 00810063]
The Countess entrusted me with the chalice, and the quest for her ancestor's tomb.

[HEADER 00810064]
You're as crazy as she is! Haven't you got enough problems - Khan and the Templars...?

[HEADER 00810065]
It's all part of the same thing. The chalice is important, I'm sure.

[HEADER 00810066]
The manuscript pointed us to the knight, and I have to find him.

[HEADER 00810067]
What then?

[HEADER 00810068]
I don't know. But when the knight and the chalice are reunited, maybe I will.

[HEADER 008100F0]
...and when I woke up I was at the police station.

[HEADER 008100F1]
Luckily, I managed to persuade Rosso I was innocent.

[HEADER 008100F2]
Poor George!

[HEADER 008100F3]
What a mess. I bungled the whole thing!

[HEADER 008100F4]
I don't think so. You made a pretty good job of distracting those two crooks...

[HEADER 008100F5]
Yeah, but the killer got away with the tripod!

[HEADER 008100F6]
No he didn't. He's not the only one who can dress up in costume...

[HEADER 008100F7]
You mean...?

[HEADER 008100F8]
It was YOU who stole the tripod.

[HEADER 008100F9]
Hell, Nico - I could have been shot!

[HEADER 008100FA]
Those dorks were more likely to shoot their own feet.

[HEADER 008100FB]
I just wish you'd told me your plans.

[HEADER 008100FC]
We're supposed to be in this together.

[HEADER 008100FD]
And how come you dressed up like a pantomime cat?

[HEADER 008100FE]
Don't sulk, Georgie, please.

[HEADER 008100FF]
Aw... rats! And don't call me Georgie!

[HEADER 00810100]
I really thought you'd be pleased - after all, we've got the tripod.

[HEADER 0081037A]
This is the chalice I discovered in Spain...

[HEADER 0081037B]
I still can't figure why the Countess gave it to you.

[HEADER 0081037C]
After losing it for all those years she simply gave it away to a total stranger?

[HEADER 0081037D]
She's one prawn short of a paella.

[HEADER 0081037E]
The Countess is a fine lady. You shouldn't compare her with seafood.

[HEADER 0081037F]
I wouldn't be surprised if there's something going on between you and that Countess...

[HEADER 00810380]
Are you serious? She's old enough to be my grandmother!

[HEADER 00810389]
Look at the chalice now, Nico.

[HEADER 0081038A]
What happened? It's shiny!

[HEADER 0081038B]
The priest at Montfauçon buffed it up for me.

[HEADER 0081038C]
That's incredible!

[HEADER 0081038D]
Yeah - it looks as good as new.

[HEADER 0081038E]
No - you found a use for a priest. That's incredible.

[HEADER 0081038F]
Would you like to look after the chalice?

[HEADER 00810390]
Oh, no. I wouldn't feel comfortable with a sacred relic in the house.

[HEADER 008101D0]
Oh, by the way - I had a visit from André Lobineau.

[HEADER 008101D1]
Oh, yeah. I hope you didn't mind me giving him your address...

[HEADER 008101D2]
Not at all. It was lovely to see him again...

[HEADER 008101D3]
He was over the moon when I showed him the manuscript.

[HEADER 008101D4]
It's not often he gets that excited...

[HEADER 008101D5]
He made a sketch of the Knight's crest to take back to the museum.

[HEADER 008101D6]
I believe he's identified the family who bear that crest...

[HEADER 008101D7]
I sure hope so.

[HEADER 0081028C]
Is there something going on between you and Lobineau?

[HEADER 0081028D]
What business is it of yours?

[HEADER 0081028E]
We agreed; all this - the Clown, the Templars - strictly business, remember?

[HEADER 0081028F]
Yeah, but...

[HEADER 00810290]
So get off my case!

[HEADER 00810284]
Just how long have you known Lobineau?

[HEADER 00810285]
André? We met at college.

[HEADER 00810286]
He helped me out when I was a fresher - showed me round, that sort of thing.

[HEADER 00810287]
You never told me that before!

[HEADER 00810288]
I thought he was just a...a working acquaintance!

[HEADER 00810289]
So he is. I rarely see him these days.

[HEADER 0081028A]
You know, he hasn't changed much - a little less hair at the front, perhaps.

[HEADER 0081028B]
I'd forgotten how much fun he could be.

[HEADER 00810052]
I... uh, brought you a present from Syria.

[HEADER 00810053]
Oh, George - you shouldn't have bothered.

[HEADER 00810054]
What is it?

[HEADER 00810055]
This.

[HEADER 00810056]
A necklace? It's rather heavy...

[HEADER 00810057]
Ethnic craftsmanship at its most rustic.

[HEADER 00810058]
Of course. I love it.

[HEADER 00810059]
You do?

[HEADER 0081005A]
It will always remind me of you.

[HEADER 0081003F]
Listen - remember the missing Spanish Templar?

[HEADER 00810040]
I found his tomb in the church at Montfauçon.

[HEADER 00810041]
So he's dead, then?

[HEADER 00810042]
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic.

[HEADER 00810043]
I was only joking, George. The Countess will be delighted.

[HEADER 00810044]
Yeah. Maybe this will help lift the curse...

[HEADER 00810045]
What now? Are you going to dig up his bones?

[HEADER 00810046]
There's no need for that, well - not yet.

[HEADER 00810047]
What I still don't understand is the significance of the chalice...

[HEADER 00810048]
Yes. There must be something we're missing.

[HEADER 00810049]
There's no point me going back to Spain until I've found out what that is...

[HEADER 00810103]
Nothing happened.

[HEADER 00810104]
Yeah.

[HEADER 00810105]
The gem fits perfectly, but what does that prove?

[HEADER 00810106]
Maybe the tripod has to be in a certain location...

[HEADER 00810107]
There's nothing on the manuscript to indicate where though, is there?

[HEADER 0081010A]
I found Jacques Marquet.

[HEADER 0081010B]
Did he talk?

[HEADER 0081010C]
Yeah - he talked - for the very last time.

[HEADER 0081010D]
He's dead?

[HEADER 0081010E]
Yeah. Killed in cold blood by a bogus doctor!

[HEADER 0081010F]
That's despicable.

[HEADER 00810110]
What kind of guy would pass himself off as a doctor and take advantage of a dying man?

[HEADER 00810111]
Was it Khan?

[HEADER 00810112]
No. I don't know who he was, but it certainly wasn't Khan.

[HEADER 00810113]
He got away - out the window.

[HEADER 008102A7]
Have you ever heard of the Hashy-ashin?

[HEADER 008102A8]
No.

[HEADER 008102A9]
Marquet said that they were his biggest enemy.

[HEADER 008102AA]
His biggest enemy was the bogus doctor.

[HEADER 008102AB]
Don't remind me! That guy was evil.

[HEADER 008102AC]
He had wild, staring eyes, like a dead fish...

[HEADER 008102AD]
I'll never trust a doctor again...

[HEADER 008102A2]
Do you think the Assassin was responsible for killing Marquet?

[HEADER 008102A3]
I don't think so. He could have finished him off the first time.

[HEADER 008102A4]
Besides, Marquet would have recognized him.

[HEADER 008102A5]
He was pumped to the gills with sedatives.

[HEADER 008102A6]
He wouldn't have recognized the four horsemen of the Apocalypse unless they introduced themselves.

[HEADER 00810391]
Have you any ideas what this lens might be used for?

[HEADER 00810392]
As a magnifying glass, obviously.

[HEADER 008102C6]
I guess I better go back and talk to that weirdo.

[HEADER 008102C7]
Which one? Rosso, or Sergeant Moue? Or were you referring to André?

[HEADER 008102C8]
I'll let you to work it out...

[HEADER 008102B9]
Do you think I should go to Marib...?

[HEADER 008102BA]
Syria is a long way, George.

[HEADER 008102B5]
I guess I'd better return the chalice to the Countess...

[HEADER 008102B6]
Hurry back, George.

[HEADER 008102BF]
I'd better get back to the quest...

[HEADER 0000041A]
It was just some police paperwork - a search warrant.

[HEADER 0000041B]
A search warrant for someone named Robert Overmann.  Not a name that I recognised.

[HEADER 00810178]
This guy named Hugues de Payen arrived one day at the court of the king of Jerusalem.

[HEADER 00810179]
He offered to protect Christian pilgrims from the displaced Muslim armies.

[HEADER 0081017A]
The king would be able to guarantee safe transit to Christians in the Holy Land.

[HEADER 0081017B]
Safer journeys meant more pilgrims, and pilgrims meant trade and wealth!

[HEADER 0081017C]
The Templars proved invaluable to the king as a mercenary army.

[HEADER 0081017D]
It was said that they never asked how many the enemy numbered, just where they were.

[HEADER 0081017E]
And as the years went by the Templars grew in wealth and numbers.

[HEADER 0081017F]
They were so rich, even kings came to them for loans.

[HEADER 00810180]
But, at the height of their power they fell foul of the king of France.

[HEADER 00810181]
He rounded them up and turned them over to the Inquisition.

[HEADER 00810182]
Thousands of Templars were subjected to torture and confessed to heresy.

[HEADER 00810183]
Of course, at the hands of the Inquisition, there wasn't much they wouldn't confess to.

[HEADER 00810184]
The last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned alive...

[HEADER 00810185]
But the treasure of the Knights Templar was never found.

[HEADER 00000AAA]
Hey, did I ever tell you about the old Irish couple and the lottery?

[HEADER 00000AAB]
No.  But I think you're going to...

[HEADER 00000AAC]
There's this old Irish couple.

[HEADER 00000AAD]
They've been married forever - like fifty years, and they win the lottery.

[HEADER 00000AAE]
And they think, what are we going to do?

[HEADER 00000AAF]
They give some money away, but they decide to have themselves a holiday in Paris.

[HEADER 00000AB0]
So they fly off to Paris, first class.

[HEADER 00000AB1]
They stay in a beautiful hotel, and one day they go up the Eiffel Tower.

[HEADER 00000AB2]
They get all the way up to the top and find themselves up there alone with two hippies.

[HEADER 00000AB3]
The two hippies have long hair, beards, long robes.

[HEADER 00000AB4]
As they're looking at them, suddenly one of the hippies gets up on top of the guard rail and jumps.

[HEADER 00000AB5]
Just before he hits the ground he waves his arms and flies all the way back up again.

[HEADER 00000AB6]
The couple have never seen anything like this before in their lives. They can't believe what they have just seen.

[HEADER 00000AB7]
The hippy had just jumped off, just before he hit the ground he flapped his arms and up he came.

[HEADER 00000AB8]
They walk over to him and say 'excuse me Sir, Good God, how did you do that?'

[HEADER 00000AB9]
'It's really easy, man, it's really easy. You jump, empty your mind...

[HEADER 00000ABA]
'... and just before you hit the pavement, you waive your arms and up you come.

[HEADER 00000ABB]
'Here, I'll show you how to do it again.'

[HEADER 00000ABC]
Just before he hits the pavement, he raises his arms and up he comes again. The couple can't believe it.

[HEADER 00000ABD]
'Come on you can try it, man. You come on up. You'll be fine. You can do it.'

[HEADER 00000ABE]
So the old fellow and the old lady get up there.

[HEADER 00000ABF]
And they say 'So when we jump, we'll go all the way down, and just before - we flap our arms...'.

[HEADER 00000AC0]
'You come straight back up again - it's really easy. Go ahead give it a try.'

[HEADER 00000AC1]
The old Irish couple jump. Just before they hit the pavement they start flapping their arms.

[HEADER 00000AC2]
Nothing. Bang. Irish stew on the pavement. It's all over.

[HEADER 00000AC3]
One hippie, who hasn't said a word, turns to the other and say:

[HEADER 00000AC4]
'You know Gabriel, for an Archangel, you can be a real son of a bitch.'
