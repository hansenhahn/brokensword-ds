[HEADER 00004268]
I feel like I'm missing something. I need somewhere to go.

[HEADER 00004272]
Head to the carpet seller.

[HEADER 0000427C]
The pattern on that rug should look awfully familiar.

[HEADER 00004286]
Show the matchbook to the carpet seller.

[HEADER 00004290]
Ultar is a talkative fellow - but what should I do next?

[HEADER 0000429A]
Examine the notice on the toilet door, and talk to Ultar about it.

[HEADER 000042A4]
Check out the kebab seller. See the brush that he is using for his kebabs?

[HEADER 000042AE]
Talk to Nejo - he seems to be the most clued in. He will give you a phrase to say to the kebab seller.

[HEADER 000042B8]
The kebab seller wasn't very pleased! What do I do now?

[HEADER 000042BA]
That didn't appear to have worked too well. Who's crazy idea was it, again?

[HEADER 000042BC]
Go and talk to Nejo about the toilet brush again...

[HEADER 000042AF]
It doesn't feel nice carrying this toilet brush around!

[HEADER 000042B0]
Give it back to its rightful owner.

[HEADER 000042B1]
Give the toilet brush back to the club owner.

[HEADER 000042BE]
I need to find a way out of this place.

[HEADER 000042BF]
You need to find a taxi driver.

[HEADER 000042C0]
Show Ultar the photo of Khan.

[HEADER 000042C2]
I've got into the bathroom, but I still don't have money for a taxi ride.

[HEADER 000042CC]
Once again, it's Nejo you need to head to.

[HEADER 000042D6]
Try operating the bell.

[HEADER 000042E0]
Try petting the cat.

[HEADER 000042EA]
Try petting the cat and then immediately ringing the bell.

[HEADER 000042F4]
What should I do with the statue?

[HEADER 000042FE]
It looks pretty dull - certainly not an antique.

[HEADER 00004308]
Wipe the statue with the greasepaint-covered tissue - it'll transform into a priceless antique.

[HEADER 00004312]
I've got a fake marble statue, but I still need 50 Dollars.

[HEADER 0000431C]
Pearl, the American lady, loves trinket like that.

[HEADER 00004326]
Sell the fake statue to Duane, Pearl's husband.

[HEADER 00004330]
This taxi! Now it's broken down. How can I help to fix it?

[HEADER 0000433A]
You need something like a belt, a long piece of material.

[HEADER 00004344]
There was a towel dispenser in the bathroom.

[HEADER 0000434E]
You need to remove the towel, but the dispenser is locked. Use the bathroom keys to unlock the dispenser, and grab the towel.

[HEADER 00004350]
Talk to Ultar about the towel.

[HEADER 0032000B]
The mirror was as clean as anything else in there.

[HEADER 002D0004]
The cat was an ugly brute who looked like he owned the joint.

[HEADER 00320004]
The design of the toilet was a little different from what I was used to...

[HEADER 00320005]
...but a toilet chain is a toilet chain all the world over.

[HEADER 00320006]
Oops.

[HEADER 002D0007]
It was the sort of bell you see in hotel receptions. Kind of unexpected here.

[HEADER 002D0005]
Oh, bad tempered as well as ugly...

[HEADER 002D000F]
There were some great bargains on the shelf. Providing you ran a junk museum.

[HEADER 002D0006]
As I didn't see the point of going all the way over there to get scratched, I stayed where I was.

[HEADER 002D0010]
I hadn't come all this way to seek out curios.

[HEADER 002D0016]
How did this guy make a living selling useless old machine parts in the middle of nowhere?

[HEADER 002D0017]
He didn't have anything that I needed.

[HEADER 002D0013]
The stand was hawking ancient machine parts.

[HEADER 002D0014]
The stand was hawking ancient machine parts that seemed to be from a stripped down printing press.

[HEADER 002D0015]
I couldn't imagine where they'd come from or who'd want them. .

[HEADER 002D0018]
The merchant was selling fruit. I decided I might have some later.

[HEADER 002D0019]
The stand was selling some fruit I didn't recognize.

[HEADER 002D001A]
This is what travel is all about. Roam the world and discover strange fruit.

[HEADER 002D0041]
Marib looked pretty defendable with a high wall all around it.

[HEADER 002D0042]
I figured going out into the countryside was a pretty good way to get lost.

[HEADER 002D001F]
The stand had kebabs dangling from the canopy.

[HEADER 002D0020]
As a marketing device, it lacked something.

[HEADER 002D0021]
Close up, I could see flies love kebabs.

[HEADER 002D001D]
It was a kebab stand and an ugly one at that.

[HEADER 002D001E]
In the still air, the smell hung around like bad smells do.

[HEADER 002F0000]
The carpet seller had an impressive collection of wares. If I'd the time and the money I might have bought a couple of rugs.

[HEADER 002F0002]
It must have taken him all morning just to set up his stall. .

[HEADER 00310008]
The outside of the ornate spittoon was beautiful. The inside wasn't.

[HEADER 00310009]
I hadn't felt a need to spit since I was twelve.

[HEADER 0031000A]
The spittoon was nearly full. What did they sell here? Drinks or expectorants?

[HEADER 0031000B]
Even if I'd wanted to spit, my mouth was too dry.

[HEADER 00320007]
It was a roller towel dispenser.

[HEADER 00320000]
The towel sat in the open dispenser like a wad of dirty chewing gum...

[HEADER 00320008]
The dispenser had opened easily enough.

[HEADER 00320009]
There didn't seem much point in closing the dispenser.

[HEADER 0032000F]
And I thought the French had strange toilets.

[HEADER 00320010]
I hadn't drunk anything since the morning and I didn't need to use it.

[HEADER 002F0004]
The carpet in the middle looked familiar, somehow. .

[HEADER 002F0005]
It was the pattern. I'd seen that pattern somewhere recently.

[HEADER 002D0030]
The stand was being watched by a young boy, maybe twelve years old.

[HEADER 002D0031]
Nejo was still by the stand and still looking bored.

[HEADER 002D0106]
What the heck did you tell me to tell him?

[HEADER 002D0107]
Patience, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0108]
Patience? PATIENCE! I've been chased by a homicidal kebab seller and you expect me to be PATIENT?

[HEADER 002D0109]
But consider, Sir, while you were running from the irate Arto...

[HEADER 002D010A]
...the irate Arto wasn't using the brush.

[HEADER 002D010B]
Hold on.

[HEADER 002D010C]
Are you telling me that I've been used as a diversionary tactic?

[HEADER 002D010D]
Your brush, Sir.

[HEADER 002D010E]
I can't believe that you put me on that kebab seller's death list for a toilet brush.

[HEADER 002D010F]
The ends justify the means, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0110]
Yeah, but I notice it wasn't your butt that was on the line, though.

[HEADER 002D0111]
`They also serve who only stand and wait', Sir.

[HEADER 002D0112]
Oh, spare me.

[HEADER 002D0104]
Hey there, young fella! Speakie you the English? Speaka you da Angalaisey? Parlez-vous anglais?

[HEADER 002D0113]
Yes, si and, indeed, oui...

[HEADER 002D0114]
...and rather better than you, by the sound of it.

[HEADER 002D0115]
My name is Nejo. Welcome to my grand emporium of quality merchandise!

[HEADER 002D0105]
Hi, Nejo!

[HEADER 002D0116]
Hello again, Sir! And how may I help you this time?

[HEADER 002D0143]
Does the word `Templar' mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D0144]
Templar... Templar... Templar...

[HEADER 002D0145]
Why, yes! Of course!

[HEADER 002D0146]
It does?

[HEADER 002D0147]
Yes! A splendid series of books by Mr. Leslie Charteris...

[HEADER 002D0148]
...featuring the roguish Mr. Simon Templar.

[HEADER 002D0149]
Great. That's a real help, Nejo. Anything else?

[HEADER 002D014A]
`The Saint' television program featuring Mr. Roger Moore of the quizzical eyebrow...

[HEADER 002D014B]
...and a stickman with a halo. Ping!

[HEADER 002D014C]
So all `Templar' means to you is Roger Moore?

[HEADER 002D014D]
I only watched it for the stickman with the halo. Ping!

[HEADER 002D014E]
He was better animated.

[HEADER 002D014F]
So, I'm correct in saying that the word `Templar' doesn't mean much to you?

[HEADER 002D0150]
Well, there was the order of knights who were wiped out in an inquisition in 1312, I suppose.

[HEADER 002D0151]
That's them! What else do you know?

[HEADER 002D0152]
Just how much information do you think there is on a Trivial Pursuit card?

[HEADER 002D0153]
A what?

[HEADER 002D0154]
From the Medieval edition. We had it on the stand a couple of years ago.

[HEADER 002D0155]
Ask me what a fewter is. Go on! I know all this stuff!

[HEADER 002D0156]
Never mind.

[HEADER 002D0157]
Okay, forget about the Templars for a minute. What do you know about knights?

[HEADER 002D0158]
Like the Crusaders? They came to the East on an insane and pointless mission.

[HEADER 002D0159]
They sacrificed thousands of lives, including their own, for insensate pride.

[HEADER 002D015A]
How anybody can find them romantic confounds me.

[HEADER 002D0118]
So this is your stand?

[HEADER 002D0119]
Oh, yes, Sir!

[HEADER 002D011A]
'Though `stand' does not begin to do it justice...

[HEADER 002D011B]
...the finest in this bustling metropolis!

[HEADER 002D011C]
This is a `bustling metropolis'?

[HEADER 002D011D]
Well, not per se. No.

[HEADER 002D011E]
How much are those books, there on the shelf?

[HEADER 002D011F]
Have you any Syrian pounds?

[HEADER 002D0120]
I think I might have a couple of Irish Punt.

[HEADER 002D0121]
Then they're too expensive for you, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0122]
You speak very good English.

[HEADER 002D0123]
Thank you, Sir. I learned from tapes that my uncle procured.

[HEADER 002D0124]
Oh. A language course.

[HEADER 002D0125]
No, Sir. `Jeeves and Wooster'.

[HEADER 002D0126]
Gussie Fink-Nottle! Aunt Agatha! What-Ho!

[HEADER 002D0137]
That's not a very friendly cat you got there, Nejo.

[HEADER 002D0138]
No, Sir, it is a very UNfriendly cat.

[HEADER 002D0139]
Why do you keep it?

[HEADER 002D013A]
Oh, it's not mine. It just rests where it pleases and today it pleases to rest there.

[HEADER 002D013B]
As Kipling would say, `It is a cat that walks by itself'.

[HEADER 002D013C]
Fiercely independent.

[HEADER 002D013D]
And it smells.

[HEADER 002D013E]
Is that your father lurking in the back of the stand?

[HEADER 002D013F]
He is indeed. A roaring fellow. Ayub's his name.

[HEADER 002D0140]
You don't sound like you respect him very much.

[HEADER 002D0141]
Don't I? Not only do I respect him, I rather like him.

[HEADER 002D0142]
For all his bluster, we get on very well.

[HEADER 002D018F]
I met an interesting guy earlier, a cab driver.

[HEADER 002D0190]
Ah, that would have to be Ultar.

[HEADER 002D0191]
A barbaric sort of chap...

[HEADER 002D0192]
Oh, he's not that bad!

[HEADER 002D0193]
You know how he speaks in pidgin English?

[HEADER 002D0194]
That's how he speaks in Arabic, too.

[HEADER 002D0203]
What do you think of that?

[HEADER 002D0204]
Remarkable. It seems older. Much older. Quite remarkable.

[HEADER 002D0201]
May I have this statuette? It is broken, after all?

[HEADER 002D0202]
Certainly, and when my father deals with that feline for breaking it you can have a Davy Crockett hat as well.

[HEADER 002D01A1]
What exactly does `'Il 'a'kl kalb' mean?

[HEADER 002D01A2]
A polite but subtly complimentary greeting.

[HEADER 002D01A3]
He won't be able to do enough for you.

[HEADER 002D01BD]
What do you think of this, eh?

[HEADER 002D01BE]
Oh, Sir! What a splendid plaything!

[HEADER 002D01BF]
One day, when I'm rich, I am going to build...

[HEADER 002D01C0]
...a world renowned collection of brightly colored balls!

[HEADER 002D01C1]
Are you serious?

[HEADER 002D01C2]
In deadly earnest. People will come from far and wide to see my...

[HEADER 002D01C3]
Yes?

[HEADER 002D01C4]
...collection. The Rockefellers and the Gettys can keep their hordes of so-called fine art.

[HEADER 002D01C5]
But answer me this....

[HEADER 002D01C6]
What good is a Picasso, I ask you, if you cannot bounce it off a wall?

[HEADER 002D01C7]
You may have a point.

[HEADER 002D01C8]
Sir, for such a marvelous thing, I would gladly help you!

[HEADER 002D01C9]
I thought merchants were supposed to be wily and never reveal what they really want?

[HEADER 002D01CA]
`Bah!' I say to mercantile greed! I have the soul of the aesthete and I desire that red bouncy thing  beyond reason!

[HEADER 002D01CB]
Do you understand?

[HEADER 002D01CC]
Not really. If I give you the...

[HEADER 002D01CD]
I've already told you, I'll help you if you give me the ball. What's it to be?

[HEADER 002D0176]
All right. Here you go.

[HEADER 002D0177]
Thank you, Sir!

[HEADER 002D0178]
People say bad things about Americans but you're okay in my book!

[HEADER 002D0179]
What people? What bad things?

[HEADER 002D017A]
Never mind that now. Remember the brush!

[HEADER 002D017B]
Right. Yes, the brush.

[HEADER 002D017C]
All you have to do with Arto is be polite.

[HEADER 002D017D]
It lightens his day, makes it all worthwhile for him again.

[HEADER 002D017E]
How can I be polite to the guy when I can't speak a word of Syrian?

[HEADER 002D017F]
Arabic.

[HEADER 002D0180]
That's what I meant.

[HEADER 002D0181]
Simply memorize this phrase, `'Il 'a'kl kalb'.

[HEADER 002D0182]
`'Il 'a'kl kalb'?

[HEADER 002D0183]
Close enough. Now go over to Arto and deliver these honeyed words even unto his delicate ear.

[HEADER 002D0184]
He won't be able to do enough for you.

[HEADER 002D0185]
Really?

[HEADER 002D0186]
Really.

[HEADER 002D0187]
No, kid. I might need this some other time.

[HEADER 002D0188]
Yes. Of course you will.

[HEADER 002D0189]
How can a jet-setting man like yourself live without a small red ball in his pocket?

[HEADER 002D01B1]
Seriously, do you really think this thing's so great?

[HEADER 002D01B2]
Take it away, you tempter.

[HEADER 002D01B3]
I'll swap it for something off your stand.

[HEADER 002D01B4]
Um, due to seasonal financial considerations I'm afraid I cannot.

[HEADER 002D01B5]
I thought you wanted this thing?

[HEADER 002D01B6]
I do, Sir. The stand doesn't.

[HEADER 002D01B7]
Which in translation meant - `It's not really my stand...

[HEADER 002D01B8]
...and I'll be in big trouble if I swap anything for something that I want myself.'

[HEADER 002D01B9]
Alternatively, is there any service that you require?

[HEADER 002D01BA]
Not at the moment but I'll bear it in mind.

[HEADER 002D0195]
What do you know about that couple?

[HEADER 002D0196]
Oh, they're American.

[HEADER 002D0197]
Is that all?

[HEADER 002D0198]
The chap's a little odd. As for the lady...

[HEADER 002D0199]
It's a funny thing but I get the impression she's a lot cleverer than she's letting on.

[HEADER 002D0162]
Look, this is going to sound a bit strange but I need Arto's brush.

[HEADER 002D0163]
What? The brush he bastes the kebabs with?

[HEADER 002D0164]
Yes.

[HEADER 002D0165]
Let me find some dirty postcards for you instead.

[HEADER 002D0166]
Nejo, this is serious.

[HEADER 002D0167]
Arto stole that brush he's using from a friend and I want to get it back.

[HEADER 002D0168]
Perhaps I could help you, old chap. Maybe. Perhaps.

[HEADER 002D0169]
Maybe what? Perhaps what?

[HEADER 002D016A]
I do not wish to seem mercenary, Sir, but I am a merchant and merchants trade...

[HEADER 002D016B]
Merchant? This isn't Sears and Roebuck here!

[HEADER 002D016C]
Well, if you're going to be disagreeable...

[HEADER 002D016D]
No! No, you're right. What would you like?

[HEADER 002D016F]
I seem to recall that you have something that might alleviate my boredom.

[HEADER 002D0170]
A globe of delight!

[HEADER 002D0171]
A rubicund spheroid of heavenly pleasure!

[HEADER 002D0172]
You mean the ball, don't you?

[HEADER 002D0173]
A tiny spherular form that barely spans my hand yet promises hours of amusement!

[HEADER 002D0174]
If you mean the ball, why can't you just say so?

[HEADER 002D0175]
Can I have the ball back, mister?

[HEADER 002D018E]
What have you got?

[HEADER 002D015B]
Who's the guy selling the kebabs?

[HEADER 002D015C]
Oh, that's Arto. A miserable blighter to be sure, Sir.

[HEADER 002D015D]
He doesn't seem very happy.

[HEADER 002D015E]
He never is. Day in, day out, a face like a wet Wednesday.

[HEADER 002D015F]
Whatever one of those is.

[HEADER 002D0160]
Does he speak any English?

[HEADER 002D0161]
Not cogently, no.

[HEADER 002D01E1]
Here! Shake hands, Nejo!

[HEADER 002D01E2]
I'd rather not, Sir.

[HEADER 002D01E6]
Hey, I got fifty bucks out of those tourists!

[HEADER 002D01E7]
Congratulations, Sir!

[HEADER 002D01F4]
Look at this! A lifting key as used by Parisian sewer workers.

[HEADER 002D01F5]
Calloo callay, Sir. I must remember this day for posterity. My grandchildren will be fascinated.

[HEADER 002D01F6]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 002D01F7]
Well, beyond the obvious, very little. That pattern seems very familiar, though.

[HEADER 002D01F8]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 002D01F9]
No, Sir, I'm glad to say. Cold eyes.

[HEADER 002D01FE]
What can I do with a blood pressure gauge?

[HEADER 002D01FF]
Don't tempt me to tell you, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0200]
Oh. A comedian. No surprise there.

[HEADER 002D0205]
Do you know the name Moerlin?

[HEADER 002D0206]
I'm afraid not, old bean.

[HEADER 002D0207]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 002D0208]
Hmmm. A man-size double ply tissue stained with Bestheimer's Number twelve, White Pancake greasepaint. Apparently.

[HEADER 002D0209]
Thanks for getting the brush and risking my life to do it.

[HEADER 002D020A]
Anytime. Glad to be of service.

[HEADER 002D020B]
What does this toilet chain mean to you?

[HEADER 002D020D]
Are you building a bathroom in easy instalments?

[HEADER 002D020E]
Do you recognize these keys?

[HEADER 002D020F]
No.

[HEADER 002D0219]
This plaster was very useful in Ireland.

[HEADER 002D021A]
Really. Your fund of traveller's tales never ceases to enthral me.

[HEADER 002D021B]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D021E]
A beautiful artefact.

[HEADER 002D01AD]
So long, Nejo.

[HEADER 002D01AE]
Toodle pip, Sir.

[HEADER 002D003C]
Pearl was actually as close to decency as she could be.

[HEADER 002D003D]
Syria's a pretty conservative country. They don't like women displaying legs and shoulders.

[HEADER 002D003E]
I wondered if the respect for local custom was accidental or deliberate.

[HEADER 002D003A]
It was a guess, but I figured the woman to be an American tourist.

[HEADER 002D003B]
Just call me Sherlock.

[HEADER 002D021F]
Hello? I was wondering whether you could help me?

[HEADER 002D0221]
Why, hi there, handsome! What can I do for you?

[HEADER 002D0222]
Hi, my name's George. I was just...

[HEADER 002D0223]
Well, it certainly is delightful to meet you, George.

[HEADER 002D0224]
I was...

[HEADER 002D0225]
My name's Mrs. Henderson but you can call me Pearl, I'm sure.

[HEADER 002D0226]
Okay, Pearl. I was...

[HEADER 002D0227]
So nice to meet a friendly American face so far from home.

[HEADER 002D0228]
Pearl?

[HEADER 002D0229]
Yes, dear?

[HEADER 002D022A]
I was just wondering if you could help me?

[HEADER 002D022B]
Why, sure, precious!

[HEADER 002D0220]
Hello again, Pearl!

[HEADER 002D022C]
Why, hello, George! It is such a pleasure to see you again.

[HEADER 002D0278]
Do you know anything about medieval weaving?

[HEADER 002D0279]
I do a little needlework but, gosh!

[HEADER 002D027A]
It's okay. It was a long shot.

[HEADER 002D0257]
Have you ever heard of a group of knights called the Templars?

[HEADER 002D0258]
Sounds familiar. I remember! Duane had a book...

[HEADER 002D0259]
`The Holy Something and the Holy Something Else', I can't quite recall.

[HEADER 002D025A]
I read a little of it.

[HEADER 002D025B]
And?

[HEADER 002D025C]
Seemed like a lot of hooey to me.

[HEADER 002D022E]
I've been talking to your husband, Duane.

[HEADER 002D022F]
Oh?

[HEADER 002D0230]
Yeah, he tells me that he runs a greeting card company and you write the poems that go in them.

[HEADER 002D0231]
Oh, yes, indeed! I consider myself the artiste of the family.

[HEADER 002D0232]
Tell me, George, would you like to hear one of my poems?

[HEADER 002D023E]
Well, maybe not just for the moment.

[HEADER 002D023F]
Okay, George, but you don't know what you're missing.

[HEADER 002D0233]
Yes, go on then.

[HEADER 002D0234]
Okay then, darlin'. Here we go.

[HEADER 002D0235]
`Our sympathy upon this time,

[HEADER 002D0236]
When your heart doth break,'

[HEADER 002D0237]
I like the `doth'.

[HEADER 002D0238]
Classy, isn't it?

[HEADER 002D0239]
`We know the grief that must entail,

[HEADER 002D023A]
When your Schnauzer gets bitten by a snake.'

[HEADER 002D023B]
Ah, it still touches me. What do you think, George?

[HEADER 002D023C]
It's...very specific, isn't it?

[HEADER 002D023D]
You think so? We sell a lot of those, dear.

[HEADER 002D0240]
So, tell me a little about yourself, Pearl.

[HEADER 002D0241]
Me? Oh, a gentleman's interest is always so flattering!

[HEADER 002D0242]
Well, my husband and I run a greetings card company in a cute, little place called Akron in Ohio.

[HEADER 002D0243]
Akron? Cute? Little?

[HEADER 002D024D]
You said that your company is based in Akron...

[HEADER 002D024E]
...and Duane said it's in Cleveland, no doubt.

[HEADER 002D024F]
Well, yes, he did.

[HEADER 002D0250]
Duane was in the Marines, in Vietnam, you know?

[HEADER 002D0251]
Anyway, he got a medical discharge.

[HEADER 002D0252]
Thing is, he gets confused. We moved away from Cleveland five years ago.

[HEADER 002D0253]
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

[HEADER 002D0254]
He also gets a little paranoid. Thinks he's a spy or something.

[HEADER 002D0255]
I'm so sorry, Pearl.

[HEADER 002D0256]
Don't worry yourself, George. We live with it.

[HEADER 002D024A]
I met your husband earlier.

[HEADER 002D024B]
He's an interesting man.

[HEADER 002D024C]
That's why I married him.

[HEADER 002D0247]
Is your husband around, Pearl?

[HEADER 002D0249]
Well, as a matter of fact, yes, he is. Sorry to disappoint you.

[HEADER 002D0263]
Have you talked to the boy on the bric-a-brac stand?

[HEADER 002D0264]
Oh, you've met him! His name's Nejo, you know.

[HEADER 002D0265]
Oh, he's just so cute I could die! I'd love to bundle him up and take him back to Ohio!

[HEADER 002D0266]
He might not thank you.

[HEADER 002D0267]
I'm looking for something ancient, you know? Something to impress the folks back home.

[HEADER 002D0268]
The poor boy was trying his best but...

[HEADER 002D0269]
...we still haven't found anything.

[HEADER 002D026A]
Have you met the taxi man, Ultar?

[HEADER 002D026B]
Heavens, yes! What a big man! Very muscular!

[HEADER 002D026C]
But you didn't go for a ride.

[HEADER 002D026D]
Why, George! You are absolutely the most...!

[HEADER 002D026E]
Oh. You mean a taxi ride.

[HEADER 002D026F]
No, Duane wasn't interested so it didn't happen.

[HEADER 002D0261]
Have you had anything from the kebab stand?

[HEADER 002D0262]
Heavens, no! With my digestion?

[HEADER 002D0274]
Have you ever heard of a hill called the Bull's Head?

[HEADER 002D0275]
No. No, I haven't. Is it nearby?

[HEADER 002D0276]
I'm not sure.

[HEADER 002D0277]
Sounds awful romantic. `The Bull's Head Hill'.

[HEADER 002D0270]
Do you know what 'Il 'a'kl kalb' means?

[HEADER 002D0272]
My, sounds romantic!

[HEADER 002D0273]
Yeah, I don't think it is though.

[HEADER 002D0290]
Are you interested in antiquities?

[HEADER 002D0291]
Am I! What have you got there, George?

[HEADER 002D0292]
How about this fine statuette?

[HEADER 002D0293]
Oh, George. That'd be ideal except, I don't know...

[HEADER 002D0294]
It looks new, George.

[HEADER 002D0295]
You wouldn't be trying to make a fool out of me, would you, George?

[HEADER 002D0296]
Good God, no, Pearl! Nothing could be further from my mind!

[HEADER 002D0297]
What do you think of this fine piece of ancient statuary?

[HEADER 002D0298]
Oh, my! That's just what I've been looking for!

[HEADER 002D0299]
Just one thing, though.

[HEADER 002D029A]
Oh?

[HEADER 002D029B]
It looks awful similar to that modern one you showed me.

[HEADER 002D029C]
Ah, well. That's because, you see, that's because...

[HEADER 002D029D]
That's because...

[HEADER 002D029E]
That's because the first one I showed you was a modern copy of this one!

[HEADER 002D029F]
And... and I sought out the artist who'd done the copy and bought the original!

[HEADER 002D02A0]
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

[HEADER 002D02A1]
Oh, George! How can you ever forgive me?

[HEADER 002D02A2]
There's nothing to forgive, believe me!

[HEADER 002D02A3]
Would you like it?

[HEADER 002D02A4]
Would I ever! I'm not carrying the money though.

[HEADER 002D02A5]
If you go and find Duane, he'll pay you for it.

[HEADER 002D02A6]
If he gives you any trouble, just tell him that I want it.

[HEADER 002D027E]
What does this mean to you?

[HEADER 002D027F]
Gosh, is this some sort of psychological test?

[HEADER 002D0280]
No.

[HEADER 002D0281]
Oh. Well, in that case it's a red ball.

[HEADER 002D0282]
I liked her too much to zap her with the buzzer.

[HEADER 002D0283]
Do you know what this is?

[HEADER 002D0284]
Lord, no! It looks painful, though.

[HEADER 002D0285]
It's a sewer key.

[HEADER 002D0286]
WHO'D want to break into a sewer?

[HEADER 002D0287]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 002D0288]
No. A friend of yours?

[HEADER 002D0289]
No, not really.

[HEADER 002D028A]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D028B]
Oh! Looks scientific! It's a blood pressure thing, isn't it?

[HEADER 002D028C]
Does this red nose mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D028D]
Reminds me of my late Uncle Abner.

[HEADER 002D028E]
Oh! was he was a clown?

[HEADER 002D028F]
No, he was a drunk.

[HEADER 002D02A7]
Here's the money Duane gave me for the statuette.

[HEADER 002D02A8]
Only fifty dollars? Oh, I hope you don't feel cheated?

[HEADER 002D02A9]
Uh, no, no. I just hope you're happy with it.

[HEADER 002D02AA]
What do you make of this greasepaint-stained tissue?

[HEADER 002D02AB]
Oh, it's greasepaint! I thought somebody had gaudy taste in make-up.

[HEADER 002D02AC]
Look what that kebab seller was basting the meat with!

[HEADER 002D02AD]
Oh, my God! That's a brush for, you know? The commode?

[HEADER 002D02AE]
I'm afraid so.

[HEADER 002D02AF]
Thank Heavens I didn't eat anything there. Oh, that's just too horrible!

[HEADER 002D02B0]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D02B1]
You're a philuminist?

[HEADER 002D02B2]
Don't they have secret handshakes?

[HEADER 002D02B3]
Oh, George! Now you're teasing!

[HEADER 002D02B4]
Have you ever heard of anybody calling himself `Moerlin'?

[HEADER 002D02B5]
Merlin?

[HEADER 002D02B6]
No, `Mooerlin', `Mooerlin'. There's an `o' in there.

[HEADER 002D02B7]
Moo Lin?

[HEADER 002D02B8]
You haven't, have you?

[HEADER 002D02B9]
No, darling. No Moo Lins.

[HEADER 002D02BA]
What do you think of this toilet chain?

[HEADER 002D02BB]
My, but you're a strange one, George.

[HEADER 002D02BC]
I've got the keys to a toilet here.

[HEADER 002D02BD]
With my digestion, you'd better keep them handy!

[HEADER 002D02BE]
Oh, but I'm terrible!

[HEADER 002D02BF]
Look! A washroom towel!

[HEADER 002D02C0]
Oh, George. You poor, poor thing. You've had a touch of the sun.

[HEADER 002D02C1]
No! I'm fine. Really.

[HEADER 002D02C2]
I've got some plaster of Paris.

[HEADER 002D02C3]
That's nice, dear.

[HEADER 002D02C4]
What do you think of this chalice?

[HEADER 002D02C5]
Now that's really pretty!

[HEADER 002D027C]
I've got to go now, Pearl.

[HEADER 002D027D]
It's been a pleasure, George! Don't be a stranger!

[HEADER 002D0025]
Suddenly I realized the horrific truth.

[HEADER 002D0026]
The guy was basting the kebabs with the toilet brush.

[HEADER 002D0024]
The stall holder's face wasn't a great ad for running a kebab stand.

[HEADER 002D0051]
What do you make of this, Sir?

[HEADER 002D0045]
Filthy! Bad!

[HEADER 002D0046]
Okay, okay! I'm going!

[HEADER 002D0052]
You buy kebab! You buy kebab! Yum! Most good!

[HEADER 002D0053]
I'd value your opinion on this, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0054]
La! You buy kebab? Na'am?

[HEADER 002D0055]
Does this mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D0056]
No! No! You buy kebab!

[HEADER 002D0057]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D0058]
Buy kebab? Kam tureed?

[HEADER 002D0059]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 002D005A]
Buy kebab! Most good!

[HEADER 002D0044]
Hello again, Sir.

[HEADER 002D0043]
Hi, what's your name, Sir?

[HEADER 002D0049]
Hello! Hello! You buy kebab? Most good!

[HEADER 002D0048]
Hello! Kebab? Mmmm! Yes!

[HEADER 002D004B]
Um. 'Il 'a'kl kalb?

[HEADER 002D004C]
Filthy! Bad! Bad!

[HEADER 002D004D]
I kill you!

[HEADER 002D004E]
Woah! calm down! I just... Feet, do your thing!

[HEADER 002D004F]
Well, goodbye. Have a nice day.

[HEADER 002D0050]
Most good!

[HEADER 002F000A]
The carpet seller looked craftier than the offspring of a fox and an insurance agent.

[HEADER 002F0018]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002F0019]
Ahhh! Give to me! Give to me! Alamut!

[HEADER 002F0014]
Does this mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002F0015]
Yes, yes. Carpets, yes?

[HEADER 002F0016]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002F0017]
Lovely carpets? Yes!

[HEADER 002F000F]
Hallo, Sir! Lovely carpets!

[HEADER 002F000E]
Murhuba! Hallo, Sir!

[HEADER 002F0012]
'Il 'a'kl kalb.

[HEADER 002F0013]
Ha! Ha! You speak Nejo, yes?

[HEADER 002F0011]
Maa as-salaama!

[HEADER 00310033]
Many beneficent greetings, my most fortunate possible friend.

[HEADER 00310034]
Huh? Do I know you, mister?

[HEADER 00310035]
No! No! And again I say No!

[HEADER 00310036]
But my friend, do you not see our mutual good fortune in this meeting?

[HEADER 00310037]
How frank do you want me to be?

[HEADER 00310038]
You are a traveller, yes?

[HEADER 00310039]
Boy, you must be the world's greatest detective.

[HEADER 0031003A]
No, I am told that is Sherlock Holmes of the big forehead and slipper full of shag.

[HEADER 0031003B]
I, as contrast, am world's greatest luxury taxi driver!

[HEADER 0031003C]
I can see where this is going.

[HEADER 0031003D]
I am Ultar, taxi driver and luxury guide per excellent, yes!

[HEADER 0031003E]
This I HAD to hear.

[HEADER 0031003F]
Where does your heart desire to go?

[HEADER 00310040]
Simply mention the name to your obedient servant and we shall fly there, swift as the eagle!

[HEADER 00310041]
Oh. Well, I don't really want to leave Marib yet but I'm sure that if I do you'll be the first to know.

[HEADER 00310042]
Is good! You know where you want to go, you come to Ultar!

[HEADER 00310043]
Thanks. See you around, Ultar.

[HEADER 00310044]
Be having a pleasant day full of shining experiences and happiness, my friend.

[HEADER 002D002C]
Embarrassed as I am to admit it...

[HEADER 002D002D]
...you can spot an American tourist a mile off.

[HEADER 002D002E]
I don't know. Even though he was obviously a countryman of mine...

[HEADER 002D002F]
...there was something about the guy that gave me a weird feeling.

[HEADER 002D005B]
Hi! I was wondering whether you could help me?

[HEADER 002D005F]
Why sure, son! Always got time for a fellow American.

[HEADER 002D0060]
The name's Henderson. Duane Henderson.

[HEADER 002D0061]
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Henderson.

[HEADER 002D0062]
Hell, boy! I'm not in the office. Call me Duane!

[HEADER 002D0063]
Oh, okay. Duane. My name's George Stobbart.

[HEADER 002D005C]
Hi there, Duane!

[HEADER 002D0064]
Hi there, George! How can I help you, young fella?.

[HEADER 002D0065]
You're a long way from home, Duane.

[HEADER 002D0066]
Could say the same about you, George.

[HEADER 002D0067]
Me? I'm just sightseeing. That's all.

[HEADER 002D0068]
Without a camera? Kinda lax to come all this way...

[HEADER 002D0069]
...and not take pictures.

[HEADER 002D006A]
Mind if I take a picture of you, George?

[HEADER 002D006B]
What? Why?

[HEADER 002D006C]
Ow! You could've warned me!

[HEADER 002D006D]
You don't mind, do you, George?

[HEADER 002D006E]
The folks back home will be real interested.

[HEADER 002D006F]
What exactly do you do, Duane?

[HEADER 002D0070]
Didn't I say? Oh, I run a greeting card company.

[HEADER 002D0071]
Yup, we're based in Cleveland, Ohio.

[HEADER 002D0072]
Cleveland? Pearl said you're in Akron.

[HEADER 002D0073]
What was that?

[HEADER 002D0074]
Uh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.

[HEADER 002D0075]
Pearl writes the poems for 'em.

[HEADER 002D0076]
You ougha ask her to recite some.

[HEADER 002D007E]
Where is your wife, Duane?

[HEADER 002D007F]
Pearl? Oh, she's around. Looking for bargains.

[HEADER 002D008B]
How long have you been married, Duane?

[HEADER 002D008C]
Hell, must be thirty years now.

[HEADER 002D0098]
I saw a medieval picture of a woman...

[HEADER 002D0099]
...royalty or nobility, something like that...

[HEADER 002D009A]
...she was looking in a mirror...

[HEADER 002D009B]
...but the reflection was of a man with three faces.

[HEADER 002D009C]
What do you think of that?

[HEADER 002D009D]
I think you should be in therapy.

[HEADER 002D008D]
Do you think bulls have any significance around here?

[HEADER 002D008E]
Weird question, George.

[HEADER 002D008F]
No, I don't think they have.

[HEADER 002D009E]
Do you mind if I ask you an odd question?

[HEADER 002D009F]
Okay, but I might not answer it.

[HEADER 002D00A0]
Do you know anything about the Templars?

[HEADER 002D00A1]
The Knights Templar?

[HEADER 002D00A2]
Yep.

[HEADER 002D00A3]
Nope. Nothing at all.

[HEADER 002D00A4]
Well, you knew they were an order of knights!

[HEADER 002D00A5]
What I know and what I say are two different things, boy.

[HEADER 002D00A6]
I haven't lasted as long as I have in this business without knowing that.

[HEADER 002D00A7]
`In this business'?

[HEADER 002D00A8]
Sure.

[HEADER 002D00A9]
The greetings card business.

[HEADER 002D00AA]
Oh, puhleeese!

[HEADER 002D0090]
Does the image of a knight holding a crystal ball mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D0091]
Hell, no! What would a knight want with a hunk o' glass?

[HEADER 002D0092]
I don't know. That's the prob...

[HEADER 002D0093]
What's wrong, boy?

[HEADER 002D0094]
It's not a crystal ball...

[HEADER 002D0095]
It all came together in my head.

[HEADER 002D0096]
What the conspirators had mentioned losing, the strange perspective of the manuscript...

[HEADER 002D0097]
...it's a lens!

[HEADER 002D00B1]
Have you talked to Nejo?

[HEADER 002D00B2]
Nejo? He's the youngster on that junk stand, right?

[HEADER 002D00B3]
Yeah, we've met him. He's a smart kid.

[HEADER 002D00B4]
Speaks four languages and he's never had a day's formal education.

[HEADER 002D00B5]
He should go far. Kept trying to peddle garbage on us, though.

[HEADER 002D00B6]
You're not going to find much worthwhile around here.

[HEADER 002D00B7]
I know that and YOU know that...

[HEADER 002D00B8]
but try telling Pearl. She reckons there's antiquities in them thar stands.

[HEADER 002D00AF]
Have you had any dealings with the kebab seller?

[HEADER 002D00B0]
Absolutely not. Pearl's already had one attack of Montezuma's Revenge.

[HEADER 002D00B9]
Have you met Ultar?

[HEADER 002D00BA]
Oh, `most luxurious, air-conditioned taxi ride, mister!'

[HEADER 002D00BB]
Yeah, the cabbie.

[HEADER 002D00BC]
Tried to pull a bunko on us. Take us on a wildgoose chase off into nowhere.

[HEADER 002D00BD]
Have you ever heard of a hill called the Bull's Head?

[HEADER 002D00BE]
Can't say as I have. Where's that?

[HEADER 002D00BF]
I don't know. I'm trying to find out.

[HEADER 002D00C0]
Bull's Head, huh? I must remember that. Sounds scenic.

[HEADER 002D00D1]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 002D00D2]
Maybe. Where did you get it?

[HEADER 002D00D3]
I just picked it up somewhere.

[HEADER 002D00D4]
Sure, I'm always picking up photos of complete strangers and then asking around.

[HEADER 002D00D5]
Ow! Dammit!

[HEADER 002D00D6]
There, I've got another picture of a complete stranger.

[HEADER 002D00D7]
Maybe I'll ask around about this one.

[HEADER 002D00E5]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D00E1]
Hmmm, looks like the kind of thing Pearl might be interested in.

[HEADER 002D00E2]
Not old enough, though.

[HEADER 002D00E6]
Good Gravy! Looks old.

[HEADER 002D00E7]
Yeah. I had to turn this town upside down.

[HEADER 002D00E8]
Boy, your luck's better than ours. Looks Roman.

[HEADER 002D00E9]
I wouldn't know.

[HEADER 002D00EA]
What they'll say back home! How much do you want, George?

[HEADER 002D00EB]
Oh, I couldn't, it's the find of a lifetime. I mean...

[HEADER 002D00EC]
Fifty bucks. Take it. Or leave it.

[HEADER 002D00ED]
I'll take it. Here you go.

[HEADER 002D00EE]
And here YOU go...

[HEADER 002D00EF]
Thanks for the money, Duane. This'll come in real handy.

[HEADER 002D00F0]
I ought to be thanking you for finding this Roman statuette.

[HEADER 002D00C4]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D00C5]
It's a ball. Big deal...

[HEADER 002D00C6]
Shake hands, Duane!

[HEADER 002D00C7]
Why?

[HEADER 002D00C8]
Just being friendly.

[HEADER 002D00C9]
Let's just be friendly by keeping our hands to ourselves, yeah?

[HEADER 002D00CA]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 002D00CB]
A manhole lifting key. So?

[HEADER 002D00CC]
Hey, how come you recognize it?

[HEADER 002D00CD]
Hey, how come you're carrying it?

[HEADER 002D00CE]
Yeah, well. Let's just drop the subject, shall we?

[HEADER 002D00DA]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 002D00DB]
Nothing. Nothing at all.

[HEADER 002D00DC]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 002D00DD]
A blood pressure gauge. Why in blue blazes are you carrying that?

[HEADER 002D00DE]
I'm carrying it for a friend?

[HEADER 002D00DF]
Recognise this?

[HEADER 002D00E0]
A clown's red nose.

[HEADER 002D00E3]
Do you know the name `Moerlin'?

[HEADER 002D00E4]
Nope.

[HEADER 002D00F1]
What do you think of this greasepaint-stained tissue?

[HEADER 002D00F2]
You've been hanging around with actors?

[HEADER 002D00F3]
I've got a toilet brush!

[HEADER 002D00F4]
What do you want me to do? Dance around with joy?

[HEADER 002D00F5]
What does this toilet chain mean to you?

[HEADER 002D00F6]
It means that somewhere, somebody can't flush the toilet.

[HEADER 002D00F7]
I've got the keys to a toilet here.

[HEADER 002D00F8]
Executive washroom?

[HEADER 002D00F9]
Not exactly.

[HEADER 002D00FA]
Here I have a washroom towel.

[HEADER 002D00FB]
Yes?

[HEADER 002D00FC]
No, that's it. `Here I have a washroom towel'.

[HEADER 002D00FD]
Oh, I was expecting a magic trick or something.

[HEADER 002D00FE]
Look, I've got some plaster of Paris.

[HEADER 002D00FF]
Yeah? I've got a picture of me shaking hands with George Bush.

[HEADER 002D0100]
Course, that was back in '76.

[HEADER 002D0101]
What do you make of this chalice?

[HEADER 002D0102]
That looks old. Is it for sale?

[HEADER 002D0103]
Sorry.

[HEADER 002D00C2]
Okay. Well, I'll see you around, Duane.

[HEADER 002D00C3]
Count on it, George.

[HEADER 0031000C]
I don't know why but I felt like I could trust this guy.

[HEADER 00310045]
Hello again, Ultar.

[HEADER 0031004A]
Praise be to Allah! I am blessed with your bountiful presence once more!

[HEADER 00310064]
Do you know anything about the Templars?

[HEADER 00310065]
Of course!

[HEADER 00310066]
Yes? What can you tell me?

[HEADER 00310067]
Great she-bop band of the sixties!

[HEADER 00310068]
Uh-no, that's not really...

[HEADER 00310069]
`Who put the 'Bop' in the 'bop-shebop-du-whop'?'

[HEADER 0031006A]
Yeah. Eternal questions.

[HEADER 00310057]
This place is certainly hard to find.

[HEADER 00310058]
Oh, yes! It is most exclusive! The membership can be no more than, hmm...

[HEADER 00310059]
Kind Sir, what would you guess the population of the village to be?

[HEADER 0031005A]
Gee, I don't know. A couple of thousand?

[HEADER 0031005B]
Then I would estimate the membership to be no more than a couple of thousand.

[HEADER 0031005C]
What do you make of that boy in the market? Nejo?

[HEADER 0031005D]
Nejo? Ha, Ayub's boy. Is too big for sandals.

[HEADER 0031005E]
I speak splendid English and he laugh! He say, `Ultar, you big ox! You split infinitive!'

[HEADER 0031005F]
I say, `I split your head if you stay still long enough.'

[HEADER 00310060]
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[HEADER 00310061]
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

[HEADER 00310062]
Pretty funny, yes?

[HEADER 00310063]
Hilarious. You should be on cable.

[HEADER 0031006B]
What do you know about the kebab seller?

[HEADER 0031006C]
A most miserable man. Ultar say, `Cheery up, matey mate! It might never happen!'

[HEADER 0031006D]
And he say, `Shut up, Ultar!'

[HEADER 0031006E]
Fancy that.

[HEADER 0031006F]
Not at all. Arto has face like the drizzle that falls on the midweek afternoon.

[HEADER 00310070]
Whatever that is.

[HEADER 00310071]
Have you met the American couple?

[HEADER 00310072]
Have Ultar met them? HAVE Ultar met them? Yes, Ultar have met them.

[HEADER 00310073]
And?

[HEADER 00310074]
They most ungenerous. Ultar offer to show them wonders of countryside.

[HEADER 00310075]
They say, `Is there anything ancient?' Ultar say, `Yes, of course! Nature is ancient.'

[HEADER 00310076]
They say, `No, anything ancient made by men?' and Ultar say, `Have you seen taxi? Fan belt older than Ozymandias!

[HEADER 00310077]
But they gone.

[HEADER 00310078]
Could you tell me what that sign means?

[HEADER 00310079]
It say, `Door stay shut until brush come back. Signed, the management.'

[HEADER 0031007A]
Oh. What does that mean?

[HEADER 0031007B]
Manager buy lovely new toilet brush...

[HEADER 0031007C]
...leaves it by washbasin for ten minutes.

[HEADER 0031007D]
Come back, it been stealen! Stolen.

[HEADER 0031007E]
Not even out of wrapper.

[HEADER 0031007F]
He damn cross! Lock toilet up and say, `Nobody use fine, pristine toilet until brush given back.'

[HEADER 00310080]
We say, `What we do 'til then, eh?'

[HEADER 00310081]
He say, `Cross legs and use the superior willpower.'

[HEADER 00310082]
And that's what you've been doing?

[HEADER 00310083]
No. Ultar use bucket.

[HEADER 0031004C]
What does `'Il 'a'kl kalb' mean?

[HEADER 0031004E]
Who teach you that?

[HEADER 0031004F]
Nejo told me to say it to Arto.

[HEADER 00310050]
And Arto come after you with big knife, yes?

[HEADER 00310051]
Yeah! How did you know?

[HEADER 00310052]
I know Arto. You tell him in bad Arabic that his kebabs made from dog meat.

[HEADER 00310053]
I said he was using dog food? No wonder he went crazy!

[HEADER 00310054]
No. Ultar not mean meat for dog

[HEADER 00310055]
Ultar mean meat of dog.

[HEADER 00310056]
Oh.

[HEADER 0031004D]
Not sure, mister. Your accent is difficult.

[HEADER 003100A5]
About Bull's Head Hill.

[HEADER 003100A6]
Are you desirous of seeing this most splendid place?

[HEADER 003100A7]
Well, maybe.

[HEADER 003100A8]
A terrific bargain, only fifty of your yankee bucks.

[HEADER 003100A9]
Fifty, huh?

[HEADER 003100AD]
Okay, it's a deal. Here's the cash.

[HEADER 003100AE]
Ah! Most splendid! As you say, `The Cash Price Moolah is Correct'!

[HEADER 003100AF]
Mister, we make with haste!

[HEADER 003100B0]
Where exactly is your taxi? The only vehicle I've seen around here is a ageing army surplus truck.

[HEADER 003100B1]
Yes?

[HEADER 003100B2]
Oh. Okay, I'll be along in a minute.

[HEADER 0031000F]
It didn't seem right to take off with the toilet keys so I left them on the bar.

[HEADER 003100A3]
No, I think I'll be hanging around the village for a while yet.

[HEADER 003100A4]
As you desire, oh mister. Rest assured, however, that Ultar is ready to transport you to Bull's Head as quick as a lickety split, yes!

[HEADER 003100AA]
Well, I still don't have any cash on me. American or otherwise.

[HEADER 003100AB]
Ah! Unfortune most extreme.

[HEADER 003100AC]
The delights of the Bull's Head hill then must wait, I fear.

[HEADER 00310086]
What can you tell me about this Bull's Head Hill?

[HEADER 00310087]
Is most magnificent! Lovely views! Worth visiting, yes, by indeedity!

[HEADER 00310088]
How do I get there? No, let me guess.

[HEADER 00310089]
You need fine luxury guide to take you there in air-conditioned taxi!

[HEADER 0031008A]
`Woe is me. Where can I find such a guide?'

[HEADER 0031008B]
And Ultar is most luxurious guide for, most literally, some way! In any direction!

[HEADER 0031008C]
Gee willikers. Lucky old me.

[HEADER 0031008D]
Are you desirous of my pleasant and luxuriant service?

[HEADER 0031008E]
Okay. All right. Let's go.

[HEADER 0031008F]
First, I regret, the formalities. A trip to the Bull's Head, hmmmm. Fifty yankee dollars, please!

[HEADER 00310090]
Fifty bucks? I don't have fifty bucks!

[HEADER 00310091]
Oh, most unhappy event! Ultar then sorry but he cannot take you on ride of lifetime.

[HEADER 00310092]
Hold on, Ultar. Is there nothing I could barter with you?

[HEADER 00310093]
Were that it was so, beloved friend. But my taxi needs gas and its muffler needs the muffler doctor. Trading for these things is not possible.

[HEADER 00310094]
My heart weeps for the injustice but it's bucks or zip, oh unfortunate American.

[HEADER 003100D5]
Have you seen this man before?

[HEADER 003100D6]
Oh, most certainly! Was here only yesterday!

[HEADER 003100D7]
Here? Yesterday? My God, he's close.

[HEADER 003100D8]
Yes, he was asking lot of questions, just like you.

[HEADER 003100D9]
What did he ask about?

[HEADER 003100DA]
He ask about American called Stobbie...

[HEADER 003100DB]
Stobbart?

[HEADER 003100DC]
Yes! Stobbart! You know him?

[HEADER 003100DD]
The killer knew my name.

[HEADER 003100DE]
What else did he ask about?

[HEADER 003100DF]
He ask about German man called Klobner.

[HEADER 003100E0]
I tried to remember the name of the man the conspiracy had lost in Syria...

[HEADER 003100E1]
Was his name Klausner?

[HEADER 003100E2]
Sure! That is what Ultar said! Klausner!

[HEADER 003100E3]
I told this man in the picture Klausner wanted to go up to Bull's Head,...

[HEADER 003100E4]
Hold on, he wanted to go where?

[HEADER 003100E5]
Bull's Head...

[HEADER 003100E6]
...big hill, ten mile out of town, maybe sixty.

[HEADER 003100E7]
When was that?

[HEADER 003100E8]
Oh, maybe a week ago.

[HEADER 003100FE]
Look, Ultar. Fifty dollars, US.

[HEADER 003100FF]
A splendid sum.

[HEADER 0031011F]
Look I've got the toilet brush back!

[HEADER 00310120]
Hmmm, you man of action, all rightey.

[HEADER 00310121]
Don't just wave at me. Give to manager.

[HEADER 00310124]
Look, I've got the keys to the toilet!

[HEADER 00310125]
Is this `Life Goal' thing I read in GQ?

[HEADER 00310126]
Look what I've got! The towel from the toilet!

[HEADER 00310127]
What you want with towel?

[HEADER 00310128]
Well, I don't know yet, do I?

[HEADER 00310129]
You sure a funny bod. Run around, collect things.

[HEADER 003100C6]
What do you think of this ball?

[HEADER 003100C7]
Is most splendid, mister.

[HEADER 003100CA]
Shake my hand, Ultar!

[HEADER 003100CB]
Ha, ha! Remind me of thing that happen month ago, maybe six.

[HEADER 003100CC]
Man come up to Ultar, say `Shake hands, Ultar!'

[HEADER 003100CD]
But man have electrical buzz thing in his hand. Ha, ha!

[HEADER 003100CE]
How we laughed!

[HEADER 003100CF]
Then I broke his arms.

[HEADER 003100D0]
I didn't think electrocuting the big Syrian was a good idea

[HEADER 003100D1]
This is a key for lifting manhole covers.

[HEADER 003100D2]
You carry some strange stuff with you, mister.

[HEADER 003100EB]
What do you think of this?

[HEADER 003100EC]
Is gadget.

[HEADER 003100ED]
It's a blood pressure gauge.

[HEADER 003100EE]
Blood pressure gauge. Is what Ultar said!

[HEADER 003100F1]
Look at this.

[HEADER 003100F2]
Is a red ball with a hole in it.

[HEADER 003100F3]
No, it's a clown's nose.

[HEADER 003100F4]
Does clown know you have his nose?

[HEADER 003100F5]
I really hope not.

[HEADER 003100F6]
Unfortunately, it seems so.

[HEADER 003100F7]
Why unfortunate?

[HEADER 003100F8]
This clown kills people.

[HEADER 003100F9]
Ah, `Alternative Comedy'.

[HEADER 003100FA]
Ha, statuette is broken! Not worth much.

[HEADER 003100FC]
Ha, statuette is broken and dirty! Not worth much.

[HEADER 00310115]
What does this greasepaint-stained tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 00310116]
Nothing. Why? What does greasepaint-stained tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 00310122]
What does this toilet chain mean to you?

[HEADER 00310123]
You got brush back so you could steal chain? You sure strange cookie, mister. Yes?

[HEADER 0031012D]
What do think of this plaster?

[HEADER 0031012E]
Not much there!

[HEADER 0031012F]
Not enough to make tasteful garden gnome, for an example.

[HEADER 00310130]
How about a really small garden gnome?

[HEADER 00310131]
Ultar not think so.

[HEADER 003100C2]
See you around, Ultar.

[HEADER 003100C5]
May good fortune follow you, mister.

[HEADER 0031000D]
The club manager's bonhomie seemed forced. Looking at the place, I could understand that.

[HEADER 0031002C]
Here's your brush, Sir. It wasn't easy getting it back.

[HEADER 0031002D]
The manager took the brush from me, gave me the toilet keys as my reward and stomped off.

[HEADER 0031002E]
What was all that about?

[HEADER 0031002F]
Manager, he say, `Bah! Look at state of this!...

[HEADER 00310030]
...Need much cleaning in detergent before go around MY U-bend!'

[HEADER 00310031]
He said all that?

[HEADER 00310032]
Body language account for much, you know! Oh, yes indeedy!

[HEADER 00310017]
Hi, nice club you've got here.

[HEADER 00310018]
I was wondering if you could help me?

[HEADER 0031001A]
What? I mean, I beg your pardon?

[HEADER 0031001B]
I'm sorry but I don't understand.

[HEADER 0031001C]
No surprise there, all righty. He say sorry...

[HEADER 0031001D]
...but he not speak English.

[HEADER 0031001E]
Uh, but, he didn't say anything.

[HEADER 00310022]
He not have tongue!

[HEADER 00310023]
No tongue? What happened?

[HEADER 00310024]
It was bet.

[HEADER 00310025]
And he lost.

[HEADER 00310026]
He won! You should see other chappie. Oh yes!

[HEADER 00310027]
There wasn't much point in trying to launch an in-depth conversation...

[HEADER 00310028]
...when I couldn't speak Arabic and he couldn't speak, period.

[HEADER 00310011]
I knew the door was locked. I'd need the key to get in there.

[HEADER 00310007]
By staring hard at the notice and squinting, I discovered I couldn't understand a word of it.

[HEADER 00310012]
Damn! The door's locked.

[HEADER 00310013]
Uh, I'm sorry? Did you say something?

[HEADER 00310014]
He say, `You not to go in toilet! Read sign, matey!'

[HEADER 00310015]
`Matey?'

[HEADER 00310016]
It lose something in translation.

[HEADER 002D0000]
The fall hadn't done the statuette much good. It had lost its arms and gotten pretty chipped.

[HEADER 002D003F]
Ultar was standing around at a loose end.

[HEADER 002D0040]
I had a feeling that something was wrong. Again.

[HEADER 002D02C8]
Hello again, Ultar.

[HEADER 002D02C9]
Is most splendid and adventurous client!

[HEADER 002D02FD]
That's your taxi?

[HEADER 002D02FE]
Oh, yes! Most assuredly! Most entirely splendid taxi in all Marib!

[HEADER 002D02FF]
Looks like an old army truck to me.

[HEADER 002D0300]
Bah! You Americans with your checkie board cabs and your Judd Hirschs!

[HEADER 002D0301]
You have lost sight of what a taxi should truly be!

[HEADER 002D0302]
About four tons, by the look of it.

[HEADER 002D0303]
There! You have hit the nail in the nutshell!

[HEADER 002D0304]
Okay already. Let's go.

[HEADER 002D0305]
Regrettably not, most esteemed fare. There is a minor problem of a tiny nature.

[HEADER 002D0306]
The fan belt has taken it upon itself to break.

[HEADER 002D0307]
So what are you going to do?

[HEADER 002D0308]
What can I do? I must wait for a ride to the garage for a replacement.

[HEADER 002D0309]
How long is that going to take?

[HEADER 002D030A]
One day. Maybe six.

[HEADER 002D030B]
I can't wait that long! We've got to get moving!

[HEADER 002D030C]
But how, my friend?

[HEADER 002D030D]
I'll think of something.

[HEADER 002D0353]
What does this toilet chain mean to you?

[HEADER 002D0354]
You got brush back so you could steal chain? You sure strange cookie, mister. Yes?

[HEADER 002D0365]
Is this any use to you?

[HEADER 002D0366]
My friend! The very thing, yes!

[HEADER 002D0367]
Ultar took the towel from me, cut it in two lengthways and gave me half back.

[HEADER 002D0368]
With his half he did the kind of fan belt replacement that is normally done with stockings.

[HEADER 002D0369]
Now. If I knot the ends together, so! Serviceable, yes! Very serviceable indeed!

[HEADER 002D036A]
Stockings might work on a Bentley but on a truck, the coarse towelling did the job nicely.

[HEADER 002D036B]
Come along, my friend! You want to see the Bull's Head, yes?

[HEADER 002D0310]
Bye for now, Ultar.

[HEADER 002D0311]
May good fortune follow you, mister.
