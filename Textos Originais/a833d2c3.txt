[HEADER 0000A028]
I need to get that tripod - but how?

[HEADER 0000A032]
If you could hide in the museum, then you might be left alone.

[HEADER 0000A03C]
The sarcophagus would provide an excellent hiding place.

[HEADER 0000A046]
Open the window, and while the attendant is closing it, open the sarcophagus and hide in it. Then wait...

[HEADER 0000A050]
I'm back from Syria, in one piece, and need direction.

[HEADER 0000A05A]
Lobineau should have had a chance to check out the manuscript by now.

[HEADER 0000A064]
Head to the museum and see what he thought.

[HEADER 0000A06E]
Lobineau said something about a Spanish family, the Vasconcellos. What should I do now?

[HEADER 0000A078]
Follow that lead!

[HEADER 0000A082]
Head to the European map. You can now fly to Spain.

[HEADER 001C0027]
The case was empty.

[HEADER 001C0028]
The glass case was intact, but the tripod had been replaced by a sign reading: `EXHIBIT TEMPORARILY REMOVED'.

[HEADER 001C0020]
In the case was a spindly tripod, blackened with age and pitted with rust...

[HEADER 001C0021]
It was identical to the tripod pictured on the manuscript!

[HEADER 001C0022]
A notice identified it as fifteenth century, from Western Ireland.

[HEADER 001C0023]
It had been found in Lochmarne, at the site of a Knights Templar preceptory!

[HEADER 001C003F]
Ireland!

[HEADER 001C0040]
What's that?

[HEADER 001C0041]
This tripod was found in Ireland!

[HEADER 001C0042]
I will have to ask you to keep your voice down.

[HEADER 001C0043]
I'm sorry. I was excited.

[HEADER 001C0024]
The case contained the tripod shown on the manuscript.

[HEADER 001C0025]
As I reached toward the display case a shrill piping filled the air.

[HEADER 001C0026]
I froze, then tried to get myself together and act nonchalantly.

[HEADER 001C005E]
Non! m'sieur, non et non!

[HEADER 001C005F]
Okay, okay.

[HEADER 001C0064]
Hey, now! Non, m'sieur, non!

[HEADER 001C0065]
What's wrong?

[HEADER 001C0066]
You must not handle the exhibits.

[HEADER 001C0067]
I'm sorry.

[HEADER 001C0060]
Now what did I tell you about touching the exhibits?

[HEADER 001C0061]
Uh... was it: `You can touch all you want so long as your hands are clean'?

[HEADER 001C0062]
Not quite, m'sieur. It was Do Not Touch. Not ever!

[HEADER 001C0063]
Oh, yeah - that was it.

[HEADER 001C0001]
The attendant had an air of self importance and the kind of steely eyes that never seem to blink.

[HEADER 001C0068]
Pardon me...

[HEADER 001C0069]
Oui, m'sieur?

[HEADER 001C006C]
Are you Lobineau?

[HEADER 001C006D]
Oh, no. Fancy you mistaking me for him!

[HEADER 001C006E]
No, I am the deputy custodian.

[HEADER 001C006F]
But Lobineau does work here?

[HEADER 001C0070]
Work? I wouldn't go so far as to call it that...

[HEADER 001C0071]
He studies here most days but, as you can see for yourself, not today.

[HEADER 001C00C8]
Do you recognise this tripod?

[HEADER 001C00C9]
Hmm.

[HEADER 001C00CA]
It's vaguely familiar...

[HEADER 001C00CB]
I should think it is.

[HEADER 001C00CC]
Very similar to the one which we used to have here at the museum, in fact...

[HEADER 001C00CD]
That's what I thought.

[HEADER 001C00CE]
But this is obviously a poor copy.

[HEADER 001C00CF]
Right.

[HEADER 001C00A4]
Can you give me any further information about the tripod?

[HEADER 001C00A5]
Certainly, m'sieur! It's infamous.

[HEADER 001C00A6]
That tripod... that belonged to John Dee!

[HEADER 001C00A7]
What's the importance of John Dee's tripod?

[HEADER 001C00A8]
Dee was the most famous escapologist of the sixteenth century - the Houdini of his time.

[HEADER 001C00A9]
Don't you mean alchemist? Escapologists use ropes, chains and handcuffs, not tripods.

[HEADER 001C00AA]
Well, whatever he was, that is the tripod he used in his experiments.

[HEADER 001C00AB]
What kind of experiments did John Dee perform with his tripod?

[HEADER 001C00AC]
Oh, the usual. Didn't you study chemistry at school?

[HEADER 001C00AD]
Yeah, but we skipped over thaumatology.

[HEADER 001C00B3]
Can I take a closer look at the tripod?

[HEADER 001C00B4]
What? Get it out of the case? Ah, non!

[HEADER 001C00B5]
That tripod is protected by a sophisticated surveillance system.

[HEADER 001C00B6]
How sophisticated?

[HEADER 001C00B7]
A painfully loud alarm bell.

[HEADER 001C00BC]
How is the alarm bell triggered?

[HEADER 001C00BD]
By the slightest pressure on, or movement of, any part of the case wherein that tripod is situated.

[HEADER 001C00BE]
It strikes me that to call your alarm system sophisticated is... well, stretching the truth a little!

[HEADER 001C00BF]
It has never failed yet! The sophistication is in its simplicity.

[HEADER 001C0094]
Do you know anything about the Knights of the Temple?

[HEADER 001C0095]
No, Sir. Not a sausage.

[HEADER 001C0096]
The sign on the tripod says it was found at a Templar preceptory...

[HEADER 001C0097]
It does?

[HEADER 001C0098]
Yeah - it doesn't mention John Dee at all.

[HEADER 001C0099]
Most remiss.

[HEADER 001C009A]
You don't know anything about the tripod, do you?

[HEADER 001C009B]
No, I don't. I never had much of a start in life, you see.

[HEADER 001C009C]
I owe what little education I gained to my uncle.

[HEADER 001C009D]
He was an optician, but he also doubled as the village school teacher.

[HEADER 001C009E]
He taught me the alphabet - well, nineteen letters of it...

[HEADER 001C009F]
The bottom row of the chart was too small even for him to read, so he left them out.

[HEADER 001C00A0]
Why don't you start over and enrol for adult education?

[HEADER 001C00A1]
You know, I never thought of that!

[HEADER 001C00A2]
Do you think if I studied hard and did all my homework I could be a Professor of History?

[HEADER 001C00A3]
At your age? Dream on...

[HEADER 001C008B]
Do you know anything about medieval manuscripts?

[HEADER 001C008C]
Not me, m'sieur. I'm no scholar - though people often mistake me for one.

[HEADER 001C008D]
It's the uniform, I guess. They see the clothes, they're impressed...

[HEADER 001C008E]
And they ask you to park their cars?

[HEADER 001C008F]
They ask me to park their... no, no, no!

[HEADER 001C0090]
They assume I am an authority on the exhibits in my care.

[HEADER 001C0091]
Whereas, you know next to nothing about history?

[HEADER 001C0092]
Of course not! All I'm saying is, I'm no scholar...

[HEADER 001C0093]
Not like M'sieur Lobineau.

[HEADER 001C00C2]
Does this lens mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001C00C3]
Not a thing, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C00C4]
Does this white powder mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001C00C5]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 001C00D2]
Do you recognize this red nose?

[HEADER 001C00D3]
I don't think so.

[HEADER 001C00D7]
Do you recognize this ID pass?

[HEADER 001C00D8]
No.

[HEADER 001C00D9]
Have you ever heard of the Club Alamut?

[HEADER 001C00DA]
Oh, no! I don't frequent places like that.

[HEADER 001C00D4]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 001C00D5]
No, m'sieur. Is there any reason why I should?

[HEADER 001C00D6]
I guess not.

[HEADER 001C00DB]
What does this tool mean to you?

[HEADER 001C00DC]
That belongs in a museum!

[HEADER 001C00DD]
Pardon?

[HEADER 001C00DE]
It's a priceless historical artefact, if I'm not mistaken!

[HEADER 001C00DF]
No - it's a plain old tool for lifting drain covers.

[HEADER 001C00E3]
What do you make of this tissue?

[HEADER 001C00E4]
It's absolutely disgusting, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C00F2]
I found this gem at a medieval site in Ireland...

[HEADER 001C00F3]
That means nothing to me, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C00F4]
How did you manage to get this job?

[HEADER 001C00F5]
I had the right qualifications...

[HEADER 001C00F6]
A military manner, squeaky shoes - and an irrational hatred of children.

[HEADER 001C00F9]
What does this ball mean to you?

[HEADER 001C00FA]
Nothing, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C00FB]
Would you like to shake my hand?

[HEADER 001C00FC]
Not while I'm on duty, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C00C0]
Thanks for your help...

[HEADER 001C002D]
It was an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus, with a beautifully painted effigy of its owner on the lid.

[HEADER 001C0051]
Leave it alone! That closet is over three thousand years old!

[HEADER 001C0052]
Closet? It's a sarcophagus!

[HEADER 001C004E]
Don't even think of climbing in there, m'sieur!

[HEADER 001C004F]
You'll be suffocated!

[HEADER 001C0050]
I always wondered how it felt to be a mummy.

[HEADER 001C004C]
Do you have a fetish about closets, m'sieur?

[HEADER 001C004D]
I just love the smell of mothballs, I guess.

[HEADER 001C004A]
No, m'sieur!

[HEADER 001C004B]
Okay!

[HEADER 001C002E]
This is ridiculous! I could be here for hours!

[HEADER 001C0045]
It's closing time, m'sieur Lobineau.

[HEADER 001C0046]
Already? There just aren't enough hours in the day!

[HEADER 001C0047]
More than enough for me. I can't wait to get home and put my feet up.

[HEADER 001C0048]
Eh bien... See you tomorrow.

[HEADER 001C0049]
Good night, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C0029]
The totem pole looked distinctly out of place in the setting of the museum.

[HEADER 001C0044]
Watch out! You'll have that down on top of us!

[HEADER 001C000D]
A metal rod attached to the wall was connected to the window.

[HEADER 001C0053]
Attention! Please do not open the window, m'sieur!

[HEADER 001C0054]
Don't you think it's kinda stuffy in here...?

[HEADER 001C0055]
Better stuffy than dead.

[HEADER 001C0056]
What's the problem - fumes from car exhausts?

[HEADER 001C0057]
Not just that, m'sieur - there's a new burger bar opened up across the street: the Laughing Buffalo.

[HEADER 001C0058]
So what's the problem?

[HEADER 001C0059]
They cook their burgers on a charcoal grill, and the fat falls on the open flames.

[HEADER 001C005A]
The amount of organic compound and smoke particles released is astounding!

[HEADER 001C005B]
Since they opened local air pollution has doubled - and it stinks like a funeral pyre!

[HEADER 001C005C]
That's why I keep the windows closed.

[HEADER 001C005D]
Don't open that! Remember the burning cattle!

[HEADER 001D0007]
What the...! Who's there?

[HEADER 001D0008]
Let's get outa here!

[HEADER 001D0003]
Oh, Guido...!

[HEADER 001D0004]
What's the big idea, you dummy? Shine the light down here!

[HEADER 001D0005]
The mummy! It's... it's come ALIVE!

[HEADER 001D0006]
If that's a mummy, I'm glad I'm an orphan!

[HEADER 001D0001]
Quit fooling around, you moron!

[HEADER 001D0002]
Get your ass over here, and bring that flashlight!

[HEADER 001C0000]
He was a thin-faced pallid guy with questionable taste in outlandish clothes. My mother used to dress like that.

[HEADER 001C00FE]
I beg your pardon - are you André Lobineau?

[HEADER 001C00FF]
That's me. You want my autograph?

[HEADER 001C0100]
No. I was told you may be able to help me.

[HEADER 001C0101]
Help?

[HEADER 001C0102]
My name is George Stobbart. I'd like your professional opinion...

[HEADER 001C0103]
Well... okay. Shoot.

[HEADER 001C0104]
Hi, André.

[HEADER 001C0105]
Hello, Georgie.

[HEADER 001C010D]
Hey - I visited Nicole's apartment.

[HEADER 001C010E]
Yeah - she told me you came by.

[HEADER 001C010F]
Whew! Quite a find, Georgie-boy!

[HEADER 001C0110]
I didn't expect anything quite so... sexy!

[HEADER 001C0111]
I hope you're referring to the manuscript?

[HEADER 001C0112]
Mais oui... of course!

[HEADER 001C0113]
Where have you been? Nicole said you were away...

[HEADER 001C0114]
I just returned from Syria.

[HEADER 001C0115]
Syria? On the trail of the Templars?

[HEADER 001C0116]
It's a long story - but I found the Bull's Head.

[HEADER 001C0117]
It was referred to on the manuscript, remember?

[HEADER 001C0118]
Yes. What is it?

[HEADER 001C0119]
A secret cave built into a high cliff face.

[HEADER 001C011A]
In the cave I discovered a map bearing a phrase in Latin...

[HEADER 001C011B]
In occidenta sita est in ora mundi.

[HEADER 001C011C]
The Island of Britain...

[HEADER 001C011D]
...lies at the edge of the world, to the west.

[HEADER 001C011E]
Strange. That map seems to contain a series of pointers...

[HEADER 001C011F]
Like I said, it's a treasure map.

[HEADER 001C01E9]
Have you ever heard of the Hashshashin?

[HEADER 001C01EA]
Why, yes. It was a radical Muslim sect whose name became synonymous with murder.

[HEADER 001C01EB]
It was formed in eleventh century Persia, shortly before the Crusades.

[HEADER 001C01EC]
At roughly the same time as the Templars...

[HEADER 001C01ED]
Yes. They gave a new word to our language: Assassani - the Assassins.

[HEADER 001C01EE]
How did the Assassins get their name?

[HEADER 001C01EF]
From the legend surrounding the secrets of their initiation rites...

[HEADER 001C01F0]
A young man who sought to join the sect was given hashish until he drifted into dreams.

[HEADER 001C01F1]
He awoke to find himself in a fabulous garden, with everything he could wish for...

[HEADER 001C01F2]
The freshest water, the most delicious food, the choicest hash and the most delectable women imaginable.

[HEADER 001C01F3]
Cool. Do you have the address?

[HEADER 001C01F4]
I haven't finished the story. There was a price to pay for this taste of paradise.

[HEADER 001C01F5]
Wouldn't you just know it?

[HEADER 001C01F6]
The young man would wake the next day to find himself back in the real world.

[HEADER 001C01F7]
He was told that he'd been given a glimpse of the heaven reserved for holy martyrs.

[HEADER 001C01F8]
A heaven he would enjoy for eternity - if he was willing to join the Hashshashin.

[HEADER 001C01F9]
How did the Assassins operate?

[HEADER 001C01FA]
Well, as I explained, the new recruits would be only too willing to die for the cause.

[HEADER 001C01FB]
They'd be instructed in the use of the dagger, poisons and disguise.

[HEADER 001C01FC]
Then, the Grand Master of the sect would name an enemy of Allah.

[HEADER 001C01FD]
And they'd stop at nothing to eliminate that enemy...

[HEADER 001C01FE]
You've got it. They were fearless - and deadly.

[HEADER 001C01FF]
Does the cult of the Assassins still exist?

[HEADER 001C0200]
Take a look around at the world today. You tell me...

[HEADER 001C01CE]
Does the name Montfauçon mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001C01CF]
Sure. It was the most grisly spectacle in Paris until the Revolution.

[HEADER 001C01D0]
A public toilet?

[HEADER 001C01D1]
Montfauçon was the place of execution for many thousands.

[HEADER 001C01D2]
A dark temple of death, with row upon row of arches, each one framing a grim exhibit...

[HEADER 001C01D3]
Scores of rotting corpses swung on creaking rope while the crows devoured their flesh...

[HEADER 001C01D4]
That explains the image of the hanged man.

[HEADER 001C01D5]
I found a reference to Montfauçon in Ireland, in a village called Lochmarne.

[HEADER 001C01D6]
Lochmarne? That's where Peagram was digging!

[HEADER 001C01D7]
That's right. He'd left the excavation before I arrived.

[HEADER 001C01DC]
Where was the site of Montfauçon?

[HEADER 001C01DD]
To the north-east, near the Canal St. Martin, but there's nothing there now.

[HEADER 001C01DE]
The old gibbet was torn down during the Revolution.

[HEADER 001C01DF]
Do you know Peagram well?

[HEADER 001C01E0]
Not really. I met him at a conference.

[HEADER 001C01E1]
I would have liked to talk to him in depth, but I didn't have time.

[HEADER 001C01E2]
When was this?

[HEADER 001C01E3]
Oh, back in the summer... July, I think.

[HEADER 001C012E]
I'd like your opinion on a medieval manuscript.

[HEADER 001C012F]
Vraiment? Do you have it with you?

[HEADER 001C0130]
No. It's too fragile - and besides...

[HEADER 001C0131]
There are certain people who'd stop at nothing to get their hands on it...!

[HEADER 001C0132]
Intriguing. Do you have a copy of the text?

[HEADER 001C0133]
There isn't much - only from a few Latin phrases.

[HEADER 001C0134]
I was kind of hoping you'd help decipher the pictures.

[HEADER 001C0135]
Without seeing the manuscript? That's a tall order...

[HEADER 001C0136]
Just tell me one thing - what does the image of two men riding on the same horse suggest to you?

[HEADER 001C0137]
The Knights Templar.

[HEADER 001C0138]
Does the Templar seal appear on this manuscript?

[HEADER 001C0139]
I'd love to see that for myself!

[HEADER 001C013A]
What did you make of the manuscript?

[HEADER 001C013B]
It dates from the time of the Crusades.

[HEADER 001C013C]
We guessed that, from the Templar seal.

[HEADER 001C013D]
It's a story in pictures, like a modern-day comic book.

[HEADER 001C013E]
What story does the manuscript tell?

[HEADER 001C013F]
I don't know.

[HEADER 001C0140]
It was probably produced for the tourist market.

[HEADER 001C0141]
Tourists!?

[HEADER 001C0142]
Oh, oui! Pilgrims, in their thousands, on their way to Jerusalem.

[HEADER 001C0143]
The tourist trade is nothing new, you know. It's been around for centuries.

[HEADER 001C0144]
Ever since Joshua made a packet selling souvenir bricks from the walls of Jericho.

[HEADER 001C0145]
Have you deciphered any of the images on the manuscript?

[HEADER 001C0146]
There's very little I can be sure about.

[HEADER 001C0147]
The slaying of the bull could be a reference to Mithras.

[HEADER 001C0148]
Who's he?

[HEADER 001C0149]
A Persian God. Almost as popular as Christ at one time...

[HEADER 001C014A]
The only thing I can be sure of is the knight. He's Spanish.

[HEADER 001C014B]
How can you tell that?

[HEADER 001C014C]
The writing on the shield, the reference to `Ave Maria'...

[HEADER 001C014D]
No self respecting knight from northern Europe would have borne a coat of arms like that...

[HEADER 001C014E]
Can you identify the Knight's coat of arms?

[HEADER 001C014F]
I already did, Georgie.

[HEADER 001C0150]
He's a member of the des Vasconcellos family - from the Costa Calida.

[HEADER 001C0151]
Were they famous?

[HEADER 001C0152]
No. They're not mentioned after the fifteenth century.

[HEADER 001C0153]
Oh.

[HEADER 001C0154]
The spotlight of history moved on. They're probably long dead.

[HEADER 001C0184]
Can you tell me anything about the Knights Templar?

[HEADER 001C0185]
I sure can, Georgie!

[HEADER 001C0186]
Soldiers, diplomats, mercenaries, monks, bankers - you name it, the Templars fit the bill.

[HEADER 001C0187]
The greatest fighting force in Christendom - the militia of Christ!

[HEADER 001C0188]
Jeez!

[HEADER 001C0189]
How did the Templars get their name?

[HEADER 001C018A]
From the building in which they set up their headquarters.

[HEADER 001C018B]
The King of Jerusalem gave them part of a mosque on the Temple Mount.

[HEADER 001C018C]
It was said to have been the site of the original Temple of Solomon.

[HEADER 001C018D]
The order became known first as the Knights of the Temple, and later the Knights Templar.

[HEADER 001C018E]
You're a mine of information, André.

[HEADER 001C018F]
Glad to be of help, Georgie.

[HEADER 001C0190]
How come the Templars became so wealthy?

[HEADER 001C0191]
There was a constant stream of new recruits to their ranks, many from noble families.

[HEADER 001C0192]
They were required to swear a sacred oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.

[HEADER 001C0193]
So, their money, goods and land were donated to the order.

[HEADER 001C0194]
The Templars soon held land in France, Scotland, England, Spain - most of Europe, in fact.

[HEADER 001C0195]
The Poor Knights of Christ became the wealthiest power in Christendom.

[HEADER 001C0199]
Is it true the treasure of the Knights Templar was never found?

[HEADER 001C019A]
Ah, who knows? So little knowledge of what really happened remains.

[HEADER 001C019B]
Or if it does, the truth has never been made public.

[HEADER 001C019C]
What do you mean by that?

[HEADER 001C019D]
The Templars have attained mythological status, like the King Arthur of the Britons.

[HEADER 001C019E]
There are people even now who say the Templars still exist.

[HEADER 001C019F]
Do you think that's likely?

[HEADER 001C01A0]
No, not for a minute.

[HEADER 001C015A]
The manuscript is being looked after by a friend.

[HEADER 001C015B]
In Paris?

[HEADER 001C015C]
Yeah. Not far from here, in fact.

[HEADER 001C015D]
Well, just give me the address and I'll come round and take a look!

[HEADER 001C015E]
I'm not so sure about that.

[HEADER 001C015F]
Maybe I should check with her first...

[HEADER 001C0160]
A female friend?

[HEADER 001C0161]
Yeah. She's a woman.

[HEADER 001C0164]
This friend who has the manuscript...

[HEADER 001C0165]
Ah, oui. The anonymous girl friend.

[HEADER 001C0166]
She lives at three sixty-one, Rue Jarry.

[HEADER 001C0167]
Ah! I know it well.

[HEADER 001C0168]
I'll drop by just as soon as I can.

[HEADER 001C0120]
I think you ought to know that the tripod is going to be stolen.

[HEADER 001C0121]
The Lochmarne tripod? No!

[HEADER 001C0122]
It's true. I can give you a description of the thieves...

[HEADER 001C0123]
Before the supposed event has taken place?

[HEADER 001C0124]
I heard them planning the raid.

[HEADER 001C0125]
They're wasting their time.

[HEADER 001C0126]
The tripod is protected by a state of the art alarm system...

[HEADER 001C0127]
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

[HEADER 001C0128]
Why don't you loan the tripod to me, for safe-keeping?

[HEADER 001C0129]
Because I'd never see it again.

[HEADER 001C012A]
Don't you trust me?

[HEADER 001C012B]
It's not a question of trust, George.

[HEADER 001C012C]
That tripod is hundreds of years old, and extremely fragile.

[HEADER 001C012D]
I get your point.

[HEADER 001C016F]
While I was in Syria, I discovered a strange, pagan statue.

[HEADER 001C0170]
It was like a head with three bearded faces. Horrible!

[HEADER 001C0171]
That sounds as if it could be Baphomet - the idol described by the Templars!

[HEADER 001C0172]
The Poor Knights of Christ had an idol that looked like that?

[HEADER 001C0173]
Allegedly. The description of the idol came from the evidence extracted by the Inquisition.

[HEADER 001C0174]
Mind you, not one statue or idol was ever found on Templar property.

[HEADER 001C0175]
Until now, that is...

[HEADER 001C0176]
Just last month, a statue of Baphomet was unearthed - right here in Paris!

[HEADER 001C0177]
Where?

[HEADER 001C0178]
At the Institut Hermétique de Nerval.

[HEADER 001C017B]
The statue is beneath the foundations.

[HEADER 001C017C]
It was discovered by some workmen while renovating the building.

[HEADER 001C017D]
Can you tell me any more about the statue of Baphomet?

[HEADER 001C017E]
It's a fearful image, even now... a bearded head.

[HEADER 001C017F]
The base of the statue is carved with Templar symbols.

[HEADER 001C0180]
One of the workmen noticed a curious stain at the base.

[HEADER 001C0181]
He claimed it looked like blood.

[HEADER 001C0182]
Blood?

[HEADER 001C0183]
That's right.

[HEADER 001C0205]
What do you make of this tool?

[HEADER 001C0206]
Interesting. Where did you get it?

[HEADER 001C0207]
From a dig in Paris.

[HEADER 001C0208]
Vraiment? I didn't realize there were any excavations in progress in the City...

[HEADER 001C0209]
Did I show you this tool?

[HEADER 001C020A]
Yes, you did - though I can't imagine why...

[HEADER 001C020B]
Take a look at this nose, Lobineau.

[HEADER 001C020C]
It really doesn't interest me, George.

[HEADER 001C020D]
Does the guy in this photograph look familiar to you?

[HEADER 001C020E]
No.

[HEADER 001C020F]
What do you make of this?

[HEADER 001C0210]
It's the biggest gemstone I've ever seen!

[HEADER 001C0211]
Where did you get it?

[HEADER 001C0212]
From Professor Peagram's messenger boy.

[HEADER 001C0213]
Peagram! Professor Nigel Peagram?

[HEADER 001C0214]
He's in Ireland, investigating a Templar site, isn't he?

[HEADER 001C0215]
He was - until he disappeared.

[HEADER 001C0216]
Did Peagram find this on his dig?

[HEADER 001C0217]
Yeah. The site where this was found was a Templar castle.

[HEADER 001C0218]
Do you think it could be part of the Templar treasure?

[HEADER 001C0219]
Oh, I shouldn't think so.

[HEADER 001C021A]
You're not one of those crazies who think the Templars still exist, are you?

[HEADER 001C021B]
Uh... well - I try to keep an open mind on the matter.

[HEADER 001C021C]
Did I show you this gem?

[HEADER 001C021D]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 001C021E]
What do you make of this ID card?

[HEADER 001C021F]
Nothing.

[HEADER 001C0220]
What do you make of this cup, André?

[HEADER 001C0221]
It's a fourteenth century communion vessel - Spanish probably.

[HEADER 001C0223]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 001C0224]
Alamut is the name of the place where the Hashshashin were based!

[HEADER 001C0225]
Where is it?

[HEADER 001C0226]
Somewhere in what used to be called Persia.

[HEADER 001C0227]
I'm not too hot on modern geography, I'm afraid.

[HEADER 001C0228]
The most recent map I have shows America as an English colony.

[HEADER 001C0229]
Are you sure you don't know where Alamut is?

[HEADER 001C022A]
Positive.

[HEADER 001C022B]
Do you recognize this white powder, André?

[HEADER 001C022C]
No.

[HEADER 001C022D]
I'd like to shake you by the hand, André...

[HEADER 001C022E]
Not now, Georgie.

[HEADER 001C022F]
What does this tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 001C0230]
Nothing!

[HEADER 001C0231]
What does this ball mean to you?

[HEADER 001C0232]
It's a juggling ball! I love juggling!

[HEADER 001C0201]
Thanks for your help, André...

[HEADER 001C0202]
You're welcome...

[HEADER 001C0031]
You've left it very late, m'sieur!

[HEADER 001C0032]
Late? For what?

[HEADER 001C0033]
Anything. I'm closing the museum soon.

[HEADER 001C0034]
You wouldn't like to get locked in, I can tell you. Not in this gallery.

[HEADER 001C0035]
Why not?

[HEADER 001C0036]
It is haunted, m'sieur.

[HEADER 001C0037]
You don't believe in ghosts, surely?

[HEADER 001C0038]
Oh, yes I do! Seven years ago a lad managed to hide in here.

[HEADER 001C0039]
He'd made a bet with his friends, I suppose.

[HEADER 001C003A]
When I found him in the morning he was cold as ice and stiff as a board.

[HEADER 001C003B]
What was the cause of death?

[HEADER 001C003C]
They said it was a brain tumour.

[HEADER 001C003D]
But on his face was a look of stark, desperate terror such as I've never seen before!

[HEADER 001C003E]
Scary!
