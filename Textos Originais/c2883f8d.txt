[HEADER 00002F8A]
I know I need the key, but the clerk won't let me have it.

[HEADER 00002F94]
Make sure you've gone upstairs and examined the relevant doors - then talk to the clerk about it.

[HEADER 00002F9E]
You need a distraction. Who's the most distracting person in the room?

[HEADER 00002FA8]
Ask Lady Piermont for help. If the option isn't available, talk about everything else, then talk to her again.

[HEADER 00002FB2]
I've searched the pants, but I'm missing something.

[HEADER 00002FBC]
As you removed the matchbook, you caught a thread.

[HEADER 00002FC6]
Give that thread a tug.

[HEADER 00002FD0]
Turn the pants over again, and find the secret pocket that the thread has revealed.

[HEADER 00002FDA]
I have the pass card, but the clerk still won't let me into the safe.

[HEADER 00002FE4]
You need the help of a certain lady once more.

[HEADER 00002FEE]
Talk to Lady Piermont again, and show her the pass card. Watch and enjoy.

[HEADER 00002FF8]
I can't leave the hotel because those thugs will steal my manuscript.

[HEADER 00003002]
You need to find a way to get the manuscript out of the hotel, without leaving yourself.

[HEADER 0000300C]
Do you remember an open window anywhere?

[HEADER 00003016]
Go into the bedroom, climb on the window ledge, and drop the manuscript into the alley below.

[HEADER 000C0000]
The guy looked just like a weasel.

[HEADER 000C0069]
Hey - shorty!

[HEADER 000C006A]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 000C006C]
I didn't think much of your trick, little man.

[HEADER 000C006D]
I don't know what you're looking for, but you picked on the wrong guy.

[HEADER 000C006E]
Maybe you'll spread the word around the sewers...

[HEADER 000C006F]
George Stobbart is on the case. That's Stobbart - two b's and two t's.

[HEADER 000C0070]
It sounded impressive to me, but the weasel didn't seem to share my enthusiasm.

[HEADER 000C0071]
Still, I figured he'd think twice before gunning me down in the street in cold blood...

[HEADER 000C0072]
I do not like your tone.

[HEADER 000C0073]
Oh, yeah? And what are you going to do about it?

[HEADER 000C0074]
If you do not go away, I will gun you down in cold blood, right here in the street.

[HEADER 000C0075]
Without thinking twice about it.

[HEADER 000C0076]
Yes?

[HEADER 000C0077]
Do you know a man by the name of Khan?

[HEADER 000C0078]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 000C0079]
It's very important I get to see him, and...

[HEADER 000C007A]
I told you - I don't know him.

[HEADER 000C007B]
I'm looking for a clown.

[HEADER 000C007C]
Are you trying to be funny?

[HEADER 000C007D]
No - I really am looking for a clown.

[HEADER 000C007E]
There are no clowns here except you.

[HEADER 000C007F]
Have you heard of a guy called Plantard?

[HEADER 000C0080]
No. That name means nothing to me.

[HEADER 000C0082]
What does this key mean to you?

[HEADER 000C0083]
Nothing.

[HEADER 000C0088]
Do you recognize the guy in this photograph?

[HEADER 000C0089]
No. I never saw him.

[HEADER 000C008A]
Do you know a guy called Moerlin?

[HEADER 000C008B]
No.

[HEADER 000C008E]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000C008F]
It is just a matchbook. Why should I recognize it?

[HEADER 000C0092]
Will you shake my hand?

[HEADER 000C0093]
Are you joking?  Who knows where it has been...

[HEADER 000C0084]
What would you give me for this ball?

[HEADER 000C0085]
Beat it.

[HEADER 000C0086]
Have you ever seen this clown's nose before?

[HEADER 000C0087]
No.

[HEADER 000C008C]
What does this tool suggest to you?

[HEADER 000C008D]
Hard labour.

[HEADER 000C0090]
Is this material familiar to you?

[HEADER 000C0091]
No. It is too horrible.

[HEADER 000C0094]
What does this tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 000C0095]
Are you serious?

[HEADER 000C0096]
Oh, yes. Take a good look at the substance it's smeared with...

[HEADER 000C0097]
You are sick... very sick.

[HEADER 000C0001]
The man looked like an amiable bigfoot.

[HEADER 000C0007]
Excuse me...

[HEADER 000C001D]
Get lost, creep.

[HEADER 000C000C]
Oh, yeah? And what if I don't?

[HEADER 000C000D]
What if I call the cops?

[HEADER 000C000E]
First, I break your arms, at the elbows and wrists.

[HEADER 000C000F]
Then, when you recover consciousness, I break your fingers.

[HEADER 000C0010]
There's just one flaw in your plans, ape man.

[HEADER 000C0011]
What's that?

[HEADER 000C0012]
It's broad daylight.

[HEADER 000C0013]
I don't think even you would assault me on a busy street...!

[HEADER 000C0014]
Of course, this tranquil square at the end of a cul-de-sac...

[HEADER 000C0015]
This isolated corner of Paris that hasn't seen a streetsweeper's brush since VE day...

[HEADER 000C0016]
This would be just about perfect for a mugging.

[HEADER 000C0017]
Pardon me - I am about to get very lost.

[HEADER 000C0009]
Yeah?

[HEADER 000C002B]
Do you happen to know a guy called Khan?

[HEADER 000C002C]
That ain't nobody I know.

[HEADER 000C001F]
Have you seen a guy dressed as a clown?

[HEADER 000C0020]
No, I ain't. Don't tell me I missed him?

[HEADER 000C0021]
Aw - that's too bad. I love the clowns, don't you?

[HEADER 000C0022]
I've seen daytime television that was funnier.

[HEADER 000C0023]
I love it when the little guys get hurt.

[HEADER 000C0024]
That figures.

[HEADER 000C0025]
Custard pies, hosepipe down the pants, then - SMACK!

[HEADER 000C0026]
A plank in the kisser.

[HEADER 000C0028]
No, I ain't.

[HEADER 000C0027]
You ever meet a guy called Plantard?

[HEADER 000C0029]
You missed your chance.

[HEADER 000C002A]
If you're quick you'll catch him at the coroner's.

[HEADER 000C0036]
Do you recognize the guy in this photograph?

[HEADER 000C0037]
Is this a trick question?

[HEADER 000C0038]
No. I simply asked if you recognized him.

[HEADER 000C0039]
Okay, then - no, I don't.

[HEADER 000C0040]
No.

[HEADER 000C003A]
What does the name Moerlin mean to you?

[HEADER 000C003B]
Nothing.

[HEADER 000C003C]
Not even if I say it in an evil, criminally insane kind of way... Moerlin! Thomas Moerlin!

[HEADER 000C003D]
Nothing at all.

[HEADER 000C003F]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000C0041]
Do you recognize the pattern on this material?

[HEADER 000C0042]
What pattern?

[HEADER 000C0043]
Shake my hand...

[HEADER 000C0044]
Nah...

[HEADER 000C0045]
Aw, rats.

[HEADER 000C0046]
Do you recognize this tissue? Think carefully, now...

[HEADER 000C0047]
Ooh... ooh...

[HEADER 000C0048]
I'm going to have to hurry you...

[HEADER 000C0049]
Oooh...!

[HEADER 000C004A]
Time's up, so I'll tell you - it's a used tissue with a liberal dump of Bestheimer's number twelve.

[HEADER 000C004B]
If you say so...

[HEADER 000C004C]
You don't recall this tissue, do you?

[HEADER 000C004D]
No.

[HEADER 000C0030]
Have you ever seen this key before?

[HEADER 000C0031]
How should I know?

[HEADER 000C0032]
Do you recognize this ball?

[HEADER 000C0033]
No.

[HEADER 000C0034]
Have you ever seen this clown's nose before?

[HEADER 000C0035]
No.

[HEADER 000C002E]
See you later.

[HEADER 000C002F]
Not if you see me first!

[HEADER 000C004E]
Just a minute, m'sieur...

[HEADER 000C004F]
What's your problem?

[HEADER 000C0050]
No problem - if you cooperate.

[HEADER 000C0051]
What do you want?

[HEADER 000C0052]
Just a routine security check. Nothing to worry yourself about...

[HEADER 000C0053]
Oh. Well, all right.

[HEADER 000C0054]
Search him, Flap.

[HEADER 000C0055]
You bet.

[HEADER 000C0057]
Hey - knock it off! Get off, you big ape!

[HEADER 000C0058]
Hold it right there!

[HEADER 000C0059]
Search him again, Flap.

[HEADER 000C005A]
Is this what you after, Guido?

[HEADER 000C005B]
Si, that's it.

[HEADER 000C005C]
I can explain everything! Well, almost everything...

[HEADER 000C005D]
Too late.

[HEADER 000C005E]
You're on your way to feed the fishes...

[HEADER 000C005F]
I'm allergic to fish! I break out in blotches when I eat tuna!

[HEADER 000C0060]
Let's go.

[HEADER 000C0061]
Nothing, Guido. Zilch.

[HEADER 000C0062]
Our apologies, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000C0063]
What? I ought to report you to the authorities!

[HEADER 000C0064]
Round here, we are the authorities.

[HEADER 000C0065]
You want I should break his arms?

[HEADER 000C0066]
No. Let him go, Flap.

[HEADER 000C0067]
Nothing, Guido.

[HEADER 000C0068]
Okay, let him go.

[HEADER 000D0006]
Hanging from a brass hook was a key and a plastic tag...

[HEADER 000D005C]
Rats!

[HEADER 000D0010]
Excusez-moi, m'sieur!

[HEADER 000D0014]
Hé! Ne touche pas!

[HEADER 000D0011]
What?

[HEADER 000D0012]
You were trying to steal that key, non?

[HEADER 000D0013]
Non way.

[HEADER 000D0015]
Just looking!

[HEADER 000D0002]
The woman was obviously English.

[HEADER 000D0003]
She had all the qualities of Boadicea, Elizabeth the First and Margaret Thatcher rolled into one...

[HEADER 000D0004]
It wasn't a pretty sight.

[HEADER 000D011D]
Hi there, ma'am!

[HEADER 000D011E]
Well hello! What can I do for you?

[HEADER 000D011F]
I'm looking for a man...

[HEADER 000D0120]
You disappoint me, my dear.

[HEADER 000D0121]
For one foolish moment I thought... but never mind.

[HEADER 000D0122]
Aren't you going to tell me your name?

[HEADER 000D0123]
George. George Stobbart, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D0124]
How sweet! I once had a stable boy called George.

[HEADER 000D0125]
I am Lady Piermont. The common reaction is to kneel and stutter, but it's not obligatory.

[HEADER 000D0126]
A real Lady? I mean... you're an honest-to-God aristocrat?

[HEADER 000D0127]
Oh I don't know about that. Few of my ancestors were honest; not even to God.

[HEADER 000D0128]
I can trace my family back to the Normans... but don't let that intimidate you, George.

[HEADER 000D0129]
Beneath that impressive pedigree I'm just flesh and blood.

[HEADER 000D012A]
The blood may be blue, but the flesh is the plump beef of Old England, so to speak...

[HEADER 000D012B]
You appear distracted, George. Is there any way I can help you?

[HEADER 000D012C]
Hi, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D012D]
Hello, George! What can I do for you now?

[HEADER 000D012E]
Are you here in Paris on vacation?

[HEADER 000D012F]
No, darling, I'm on holiday.

[HEADER 000D0130]
I needed to get away after Algy's funeral.

[HEADER 000D0131]
I didn't realize you were mourning the loss of a loved one.

[HEADER 000D0132]
I'm not. He was my husband.

[HEADER 000D0133]
I'm sorry to hear about your husband's death...

[HEADER 000D0134]
You wouldn't be if you knew him, my dear.

[HEADER 000D0135]
It gave me the opportunity to take a well-deserved holiday.

[HEADER 000D0136]
Daphne suggested a change of scenery: Paris, she said.

[HEADER 000D0137]
A wild romance is just what you need to take your mind off the inquest.

[HEADER 000D0138]
Well, the closest I came to romance was being wooed by a drunken Breton chef.

[HEADER 000D0139]
I must say I was disappointed with his coq au vin.

[HEADER 000D013A]
Not at all what I was expecting.

[HEADER 000D013B]
I was thinking of cutting my holiday short, packing my bags and heading back for Hemel Hempstead...

[HEADER 000D013C]
That was... until last night.

[HEADER 000D013D]
What happened to you last night?

[HEADER 000D013E]
I was stricken, Mr Stobbart. Cupid's arrow has cleft my bosom!

[HEADER 000D013F]
He couldn't really miss...

[HEADER 000D0140]
It was just as I'd always imagined it should be.

[HEADER 000D0141]
The intimacy of candlelight, romantic music tinkling across the room...

[HEADER 000D0142]
And then - a stranger's glance!

[HEADER 000D0143]
Those brooding eyes! That suave manner! Those tight trousers!

[HEADER 000D0144]
He was the man I'd been waiting for all my life.

[HEADER 000D0145]
I'm glad he finally turned up after all these years.

[HEADER 000D0146]
Ah, but it wasn't to be. He was merely toying with my affections!

[HEADER 000D0147]
And if I ever catch up with him, he's dead.

[HEADER 000D0148]
Who was the guy who led you on?

[HEADER 000D0149]
His name is Moerlin.

[HEADER 000D016A]
I got the key. Thanks for your help, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D01F4]
This is the key to room twenty-one...

[HEADER 000D01F5]
That's next to the room taken by that rotten Moerlin, isn't it?

[HEADER 000D01F6]
Yes, and it's vacant.

[HEADER 000D01F7]
Really? How convenient...

[HEADER 000D01F9]
Maybe it was my imagination, but I had an uncomfortable feeling about this situation.

[HEADER 000D01F8]
Uh... yeah.

[HEADER 000D0164]
I didn't get the key.

[HEADER 000D0165]
Well, you really must be quicker.

[HEADER 000D0166]
Let's give it another try...

[HEADER 000D0167]
Boy! Check my jewellery hasn't been stolen.

[HEADER 000D0169]
Oui, Madame.

[HEADER 000D011B]
Over to you, my dear.

[HEADER 000D0162]
I really need that key bad...

[HEADER 000D0163]
I'm not convinced I should help you, darling.

[HEADER 000D014A]
Would you distract the clerk while I borrow a key?

[HEADER 000D014B]
Are you asking me to aid you in a criminal act, darling?

[HEADER 000D014C]
Oh, no! It's the key to an empty room.

[HEADER 000D014D]
And why, may I ask, do you wish to gain access to an empty room?

[HEADER 000D014E]
Do you plan to squat?

[HEADER 000D014F]
No, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D0150]
Scout's honour?

[HEADER 000D0151]
I was never in the boy scouts, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D0152]
You should have been. What were your parents thinking of?

[HEADER 000D0153]
It's a fine way for a boy to get licked into shape.

[HEADER 000D0157]
Now, tell me - why do you want to get into that room?

[HEADER 000D0158]
It's next to the room the killer is using...

[HEADER 000D0159]
Ah! So you plan to eavesdrop on Moerlin?

[HEADER 000D015A]
I was hoping there might be a connecting door.

[HEADER 000D015B]
What killer?

[HEADER 000D015C]
It's a long story.

[HEADER 000D015E]
Well! How can I refuse?

[HEADER 000D0111]
I shouldn't think my feminine charms would be much use in this case...

[HEADER 000D0112]
But a good dose of English arrogance might do the trick!

[HEADER 000D0113]
I say, you there! Flunkey!

[HEADER 000D0114]
Oui, Madame?

[HEADER 000D0115]
Listen carefully. You do understand English, don't you?

[HEADER 000D0116]
But of course, Madame!

[HEADER 000D0117]
Good! I wish to deposit some jewellery for safe-keeping.

[HEADER 000D0118]
I understand.

[HEADER 000D0119]
Are you quite certain?

[HEADER 000D011A]
Bien sûr, Madame!

[HEADER 000D016B]
Did you know there's a gangster out front?

[HEADER 000D016C]
What makes you think he's a gangster?

[HEADER 000D016D]
The Italian suit and the bulge in his pocket.

[HEADER 000D016E]
I know plenty of men with Italian suits and bulges in their pockets...

[HEADER 000D016F]
That doesn't necessarily make them gangsters!

[HEADER 000D0170]
That gangster I told you about - he went through my pockets just now!

[HEADER 000D0171]
Good heavens! One never knows what to expect in foreign parts.

[HEADER 000D0172]
Thank you for the warning, young man.

[HEADER 000D0173]
I shall hide my credit cards in my underwear...

[HEADER 000D0174]
I'm looking for a murderer.

[HEADER 000D0175]
Good heavens! You're a private detective?

[HEADER 000D0176]
That's correct, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D0177]
What's the term you Americans use...?

[HEADER 000D0178]
It's on the tip of my tongue...

[HEADER 000D0179]
I believe what you're thinking of is `dick'.

[HEADER 000D017A]
Precisely.

[HEADER 000D017B]
Have you come across a man who calls himself Khan?

[HEADER 000D017C]
I am familiar with only one person named Khan.

[HEADER 000D017D]
Genghis Khan - the legendary Mongol barbarian chieftain?

[HEADER 000D017E]
No, darling - Kevin.

[HEADER 000D017F]
Kevin Khan? I never heard of him.

[HEADER 000D0180]
I'd be most surprised if you had, darling. He's a pharmacist in Hemel Hempstead.

[HEADER 000D0181]
Organizes fund raising for the Rotarians. Lovely man.

[HEADER 000D0182]
Does he have a scar on his cheek?

[HEADER 000D0183]
I really wouldn't know, sweetie.

[HEADER 000D0197]
Has Moerlin returned to the hotel?

[HEADER 000D0198]
No, he hasn't. Are you going to search his room?

[HEADER 000D0199]
If I could get in there I would.

[HEADER 000D019A]
And that's why you want the key?

[HEADER 000D019B]
Yes, ma'am.

[HEADER 000D0191]
Are you sure you saw Moerlin putting documents in the safe?

[HEADER 000D0192]
Yes, darling. Positive.

[HEADER 000D0193]
I wonder what they were?

[HEADER 000D0194]
Obviously something of great importance.

[HEADER 000D0195]
Yeah. I'd sure like to get my hands on whatever it is.

[HEADER 000D0196]
I'll bet they had something to do with Plantard's briefcase...

[HEADER 000D018A]
When did you last see Moerlin?

[HEADER 000D018B]
It was no more than an hour ago...

[HEADER 000D018C]
He came downstairs and spoke to that clerk chappie.

[HEADER 000D018D]
Something passed hands - I couldn't see what, exactly.

[HEADER 000D018E]
A briefcase?

[HEADER 000D018F]
No - smaller than that. A bundle of papers, perhaps.

[HEADER 000D0190]
The clerk put it in the hotel safe, and Moerlin went out.

[HEADER 000D0184]
The man you know as Moerlin is a fake.

[HEADER 000D0185]
What do you mean, sweetie?

[HEADER 000D0186]
He's a murderer. He also uses the name `Khan'

[HEADER 000D0187]
I am shocked, Mister Stobbart. Shaken!

[HEADER 000D0188]
I took him to be a gentleman, a man of honour...

[HEADER 000D0189]
Do you know, I'd rather like to assist you in stitching him up!

[HEADER 000D01D6]
This is what Moerlin was so keen to hide...

[HEADER 000D01D7]
Really? All that fuss for a sample of wallpaper?

[HEADER 000D01D8]
It's some kind of manuscript, and it looks to be very old.

[HEADER 000D01D9]
If I was you, I'd keep it well out of sight until you're clear of this place.

[HEADER 000D01DA]
That's exactly what I was thinking.

[HEADER 000D01DB]
I could roll it up and put it down my pants...

[HEADER 000D01DC]
No, no - that won't do at all.

[HEADER 000D01DD]
You'd attract far too much attention.

[HEADER 000D01DE]
Thanks for helping me get the manuscript, Lady Piermont.

[HEADER 000D01DF]
Anytime, my dear.

[HEADER 000D01BB]
I found this pass in Moerlin's room...

[HEADER 000D01BC]
So - that deceitful little man is passing himself off as an electrician, is he?

[HEADER 000D01BD]
Uh-huh. This guy probably has a million faces...

[HEADER 000D01BE]
I showed the pass to the clerk, hoping he'd give me Moerlin's papers...

[HEADER 000D01BF]
...but he wouldn't buy it. He's too scared.

[HEADER 000D01C0]
I'll give him something to be scared of!

[HEADER 000D01C1]
Follow me, George!

[HEADER 000D01C2]
Did you place a package from Moerlin in the hotel safe?

[HEADER 000D01C3]
I did, Madame.

[HEADER 000D01C4]
And did my friend here show you Moerlin's identification?

[HEADER 000D01C5]
Indeed he did, but...

[HEADER 000D01C6]
What's the problem?

[HEADER 000D01C7]
He isn't Moerlin.

[HEADER 000D01C8]
A mere academic detail. Give him the package.

[HEADER 000D01C9]
But - that is against the law!

[HEADER 000D01CA]
I happen to be a Justice of the Peace, you silly man.

[HEADER 000D01CB]
I am the Law!

[HEADER 000D01CC]
If he tries anything - shoot him, George.

[HEADER 000D01CD]
My pleasure, Lady Piermont.

[HEADER 000D01CE]
One moment, please.

[HEADER 000D01CF]
You know, I haven't enjoyed myself this much since Greenham Common!

[HEADER 000D01D0]
I don't know what I would have done without you, Lady Piermont.

[HEADER 000D01D1]
Voila, m'sieur. Le manuscript du Monsieur Moerlin.

[HEADER 000D01D2]
Thanks.

[HEADER 000D01D3]
How satisfying. An Anglo-American alliance that actually worked!

[HEADER 000D01D4]
The clerk had given me a tightly rolled sheet of parchment.

[HEADER 000D01D5]
I decided not to unroll it until I was safely back in Nico's apartment...

[HEADER 000D01B9]
Would you like to keep Moerlin's pass as a memento?

[HEADER 000D01BA]
No, darling. My broken heart is reminder enough...

[HEADER 000D01B0]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 000D01B1]
My God! It's him. That's Moerlin!

[HEADER 000D01B2]
She represented everything I loved about the English. The lady was totally deranged.

[HEADER 000D01B3]
Merlin? You mean King Arthur's wizard?

[HEADER 000D01B4]
Good heavens, no. M'sieur Moerlin is a fellow guest.

[HEADER 000D01B5]
He's the man I've been telling you about!

[HEADER 000D01B6]
That's the man who spurned me!

[HEADER 000D01B7]
Did I show you this photograph?

[HEADER 000D01B8]
Yes, darling.

[HEADER 000D01A6]
Do you know what this is?

[HEADER 000D01A7]
At a guess, I'd say it was a clown's nose.

[HEADER 000D01A8]
That's right. It was worn as a disguise by a vicious killer.

[HEADER 000D01A9]
Ah! Mr Moerlin, perchance?

[HEADER 000D01AA]
That's him.

[HEADER 000D01AB]
Good heavens! Are you trying to alarm me?

[HEADER 000D01AC]
It's true. He uses the name Khan.

[HEADER 000D01AD]
I've never heard of the man.

[HEADER 000D01AE]
Did I show you this false nose?

[HEADER 000D01AF]
Yes, you did.

[HEADER 000D01E0]
Can you think of any use for this tool, ma'am?

[HEADER 000D01E1]
I can think of someone I'd like to use it on!

[HEADER 000D01E2]
I found this matchbook in Moerlin's bedroom...

[HEADER 000D01E3]
It came from the Club Alamut.

[HEADER 000D01E4]
It might be useful to find out if that club is in Paris, George.

[HEADER 000D01E8]
I just couldn't bring myself to use the buzzer on this dear lady...

[HEADER 000D01E9]
Does the name on this card mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D01EA]
Augustin Rosso? No, dear - nothing.

[HEADER 000D01EE]
Does this tissue mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D01F2]
I'm no shrinking violet, but that object makes me feel quite queasy!

[HEADER 000D0005]
The clerk wore a disdainful expression like he'd been born with it.

[HEADER 000D0017]
I want some information...

[HEADER 000D0018]
Who are you - the police?

[HEADER 000D0019]
I'm conducting a private investigation.

[HEADER 000D001A]
Ah! I know only too well what you mean.

[HEADER 000D001B]
That is one of the drawbacks of the catering business.

[HEADER 000D001C]
When people book into an hotel, they leave their morals at home, non?

[HEADER 000D001D]
What now, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000D001E]
I've just been manhandled by a gorilla.

[HEADER 000D001F]
Yes? I do not see any signs of a gorilla.

[HEADER 000D0020]
No, not a real gorilla - it was a guy who LOOKED like a gorilla.

[HEADER 000D0021]
It happened right out front of this building.

[HEADER 000D0022]
Let me get this quite clear...

[HEADER 000D0023]
Are you complaining, or bragging?

[HEADER 000D0024]
I want to know what you're going to do about it!

[HEADER 000D0025]
The scrawny one has a gun!

[HEADER 000D0026]
I suggest you contact the police.

[HEADER 000D0027]
Can't you do anything about them?

[HEADER 000D0028]
What goes on in the streets of Paris is hardly my responsibility!

[HEADER 000D0029]
Aren't you concerned that your guests are being intimidated by gangsters?

[HEADER 000D002A]
No-one else has complained, m'sieur. Did they steal anything from you?

[HEADER 000D002B]
Well, no. They didn't find what they were looking for.

[HEADER 000D002C]
What was that?

[HEADER 000D002D]
I don't know. I don't think they did, either.

[HEADER 000D002E]
I'm looking for a man who dresses like a clown.

[HEADER 000D002F]
This is a highly respectable hotel, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0030]
There are no clowns here.

[HEADER 000D0031]
If you say so.

[HEADER 000D0050]
Do you know a man named Plantard?

[HEADER 000D0051]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0032]
Do you have a guest by the name of Khan?

[HEADER 000D0033]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0034]
Perhaps you would care to check the register...?

[HEADER 000D0035]
I already did.

[HEADER 000D0036]
Alors - you know I am telling the truth.

[HEADER 000D0037]
May Saint Armand strike me down if I lie!

[HEADER 00001965]
The man who calls himself Khan has a scar on his right cheek...

[HEADER 000D0039]
Vraiment? I tell you I do not know a man named Khan.

[HEADER 000D003A]
Maybe not, but I'd noticed a change in his expression when I mentioned the scar...

[HEADER 000D004C]
He's already killed once, twice, maybe as many as three times!

[HEADER 000D004D]
With your help I just might be able to stop him.

[HEADER 000D004E]
But what if he finds out I have helped you?

[HEADER 000D004F]
Non - I cannot do it.

[HEADER 000D0044]
I insist you give me the key to Moerlin's room.

[HEADER 000D0045]
I cannot do that, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0046]
This guy Moerlin is a menace.

[HEADER 000D0047]
So you say, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0048]
He's not only a danger to society, but to your guests as well.

[HEADER 000D0049]
He has toyed with the affections of Lady Piermont.

[HEADER 000D004A]
Ciel! Are there no depths to which he will not sink?

[HEADER 000D004B]
Precisely.

[HEADER 000D003B]
I believe Khan, the man with the scar, is also known as Moerlin.

[HEADER 000D003C]
The man who has taken room twenty-two.

[HEADER 000D003D]
What of it? What do you want?

[HEADER 000D003E]
Access to his room.

[HEADER 000D003F]
Do you have a license, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000D0040]
Huh?

[HEADER 000D0041]
A private investigator's license?

[HEADER 000D0042]
Well, not exactly, but I can explain everything...

[HEADER 000D0043]
I am sorry, but without credentials, I cannot help.

[HEADER 000D0052]
About the key hanging on the hook over there...

[HEADER 000D0053]
Oui, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000D0054]
Which room is it for?

[HEADER 000D0055]
Number twenty-one.

[HEADER 000D0056]
Is that room taken?

[HEADER 000D0057]
Non. The guests checked out this morning.

[HEADER 000D0058]
I'd like to check in to room twenty-one.

[HEADER 000D0059]
That is not possible.

[HEADER 000D005A]
How come? You said it was vacant!

[HEADER 000D005B]
It is reserved for another guest.

[HEADER 000D005D]
Non, m'sieur - Dutch.

[HEADER 000D007E]
Do you recognize this key?

[HEADER 000D007F]
That is the property of the Hotel Ubu!

[HEADER 000D0080]
Correct.

[HEADER 000D0081]
May I ask how it found its way from the little hook to your pocket?

[HEADER 000D0082]
Would you believe it was put there by a poltergeist?

[HEADER 000D0083]
Non, m'sieur. The Hotel is regularly serviced by an exorcist.

[HEADER 000D0084]
If we had a ghost, Father Fécond would have flushed it out.

[HEADER 000D0085]
I suppose you want the key back...

[HEADER 000D0086]
Not especialement. The room is vacant.

[HEADER 000D0087]
Since you are so determined to conduct your little investigation, I won't stop you.

[HEADER 000D0088]
Are you sure you don't want the key back?

[HEADER 000D0089]
No - you keep it until you've finished playing detectives.

[HEADER 000D00AD]
Hey - shake my hand.

[HEADER 000D00AE]
I'd rather not, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D00AF]
I'm still sore from the shock administered by one of the guests.

[HEADER 000D00B0]
He was secretly concealing an electrical device in the palm of his hand.

[HEADER 000D00B1]
Practical jokes are so puerile, don't you think?

[HEADER 000D00B2]
Oh, yeah. Sure.

[HEADER 000D00B3]
I have already explained why I would rather not.

[HEADER 000D005E]
I'd like to retrieve something from your safe...

[HEADER 000D005F]
Ah oui, m'sieur. May I see some form of identification?

[HEADER 000D0060]
Ah, like what?

[HEADER 000D0061]
A driving license, perhaps?

[HEADER 000D0062]
I don't drive.

[HEADER 000D0063]
Your passport?

[HEADER 000D0064]
I don't have it with me. I could show you my operation scar...?

[HEADER 000D0065]
I'm sorry, m'sieur. I must have some form of unique I.D.

[HEADER 000D0066]
You won't find a more unique I.D. than my scar!

[HEADER 000D0067]
I'm sorry. I must insist on a more traditional identification.

[HEADER 000D0068]
Rats!

[HEADER 000D009E]
Does this pass mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D009F]
That is M'sieur Moerlin's property!

[HEADER 000D00A0]
That's right. Moerlin the murderer.

[HEADER 000D00A1]
I want to see what he's left in your safe.

[HEADER 000D00A2]
Impossible! I cannot betray his confidence, no matter what you say he's done.

[HEADER 000D00A3]
You're making a big mistake.

[HEADER 000D00A4]
Maybe. I can live with that.

[HEADER 000D00A5]
A murderer? Are you sure?

[HEADER 000D00A6]
Positive.

[HEADER 000D00A7]
Did I show you this pass?

[HEADER 000D00A8]
Oui, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0097]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 000D0098]
Yes, m'sieur. That man is one of our guests.

[HEADER 000D0099]
What name?

[HEADER 000D009A]
I cannot tell you that.

[HEADER 000D009B]
It's Moerlin, isn't it?

[HEADER 000D009C]
Alias Khan, the clown.

[HEADER 000D009D]
I told you - I cannot tell you that.

[HEADER 000D008C]
Did I show you this photograph?

[HEADER 000D008D]
Yes, you did, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D008E]
Would it make a difference if I told you the guy in the photo was a murderer?

[HEADER 000D008F]
We are accustomed to catering for celebrities, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0090]
Movie stars, politicians, royalty, sporting personalities - they all stay here.

[HEADER 000D0091]
Is this Moerlin, room twenty-two?

[HEADER 000D0092]
I couldn't say. It's a bad likeness.

[HEADER 000D0093]
This photo was taken by one of Europe's most promising photo-journalists.

[HEADER 000D0094]
Vraiment? What does he use - a pinhole camera?

[HEADER 000D0095]
Can you tell me which room the man in the photograph has taken?

[HEADER 000D0096]
Oh, no, m'sieur! That information is confidential.

[HEADER 000D00AB]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D00AC]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0076]
Would you like to relax with this ball?

[HEADER 000D0077]
Don't be ridiculous.

[HEADER 000D0078]
Would you like this device for measuring blood pressure?

[HEADER 000D0079]
I can't imagine why I'd want that.

[HEADER 000D007A]
Do you recognize this tripod?

[HEADER 000D007B]
Certainly not!

[HEADER 000D007C]
Do you want this manuscript back?

[HEADER 000D007D]
After all the fuss it caused? No - you keep it.

[HEADER 000D008A]
Do you recognize this red nose?

[HEADER 000D008B]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D00A9]
What do you make of this tool?

[HEADER 000D00AA]
Stunning, m'sieur! I bet you handle it like a professional...

[HEADER 000D00B4]
Check out my I.D. card...

[HEADER 000D00B5]
Your I.D. card, m'sieur? I don't think so.

[HEADER 000D00B6]
Uh... no. It's Rosso's card.

[HEADER 000D00B7]
Attempting to impersonate a policeman is a criminal offense, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D00B8]
Aw. Forget it.

[HEADER 000D00B9]
What do you make of this tissue?

[HEADER 000D00BA]
Do you wish me to dispose of it for you, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000D00BB]
Hey, no! It could be useful. I'm holding on to this.

[HEADER 000D00BC]
As you wish, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D00BD]
Perhaps you would like a little plastic baggy to keep it in?

[HEADER 000D00BE]
No. It's fine the way it is.

[HEADER 000D00BF]
You have shown me that already, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000D0000]
I recognised the guy.

[HEADER 000D0001]
It was the Nobel prize winner from the country whose name I couldn't pronounce.

[HEADER 000D00C1]
Excuse me - didn't I see your picture in the news?

[HEADER 000D00C2]
You're that Nobel Prize winner, from some unpronounceable Eastern European state?

[HEADER 000D00C3]
Yes. That is me, in person.

[HEADER 000D00C4]
I don't want to worry you, but have you had any threats on your life?

[HEADER 000D00C5]
You know - mysterious phone calls, letters made up of headlines cut from the newspaper...

[HEADER 000D00C6]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[HEADER 000D00C7]
Hello again.

[HEADER 000D00C8]
Have you seen a clown?

[HEADER 000D00C9]
I beg your pardon?

[HEADER 000D00CA]
The clown. A guy in funny pants. Have you seen him?

[HEADER 000D00CB]
My pants are from England.

[HEADER 000D00CC]
Marks and Spencer.

[HEADER 000D00CD]
They are a pleasure and a comfort to wear, with much support.

[HEADER 000D00CE]
I'm real glad to hear that.

[HEADER 000D00CF]
You know, it's good to know you Nobel Prize winners are human too.

[HEADER 000D00D0]
In my country the people make do with string and egg cartons.

[HEADER 000D00D1]
For pants?

[HEADER 000D00D2]
For everything. Oppression is the mother of ingenuity.

[HEADER 000D00DA]
Do you know a guy called Plantard?

[HEADER 000D00DB]
I don't know anybody in Paris.

[HEADER 000D00DC]
Oh. Well, this guy's dead, anyhow.

[HEADER 000D00DD]
Why do you ask me about dead men?

[HEADER 000D00DE]
I have seen enough of death to last me a lifetime.

[HEADER 000D00DF]
I'm... uh, sure you have.

[HEADER 000D00D3]
What's your interest in Khan?

[HEADER 000D00D4]
He is an enemy of my people.

[HEADER 000D00D5]
You know he's a killer?

[HEADER 000D00D6]
Of course, amongst other things...

[HEADER 000D00D7]
Would you help me investigate Khan?

[HEADER 000D00D8]
That is not possible. My instructions are to observe.

[HEADER 000D00D9]
I cannot jeopardise my position as an honoured guest of this country's government.

[HEADER 000D00E2]
Have you any idea what this tool might be used for?

[HEADER 000D00E3]
I cannot guess...

[HEADER 000D00E4]
Would it mean anything if I told you it was for lifting drain covers?

[HEADER 000D00E5]
Such technology fills me with wonder!

[HEADER 000D00E6]
Do you recognize this tool?

[HEADER 000D00E7]
Already you have astounded me with your advanced Western prong.

[HEADER 000D00E8]
Does the name on this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D00E9]
Indeed it does, for Alamut was the home of the Old Man of the Mountains.

[HEADER 000D00EA]
You do not know him?

[HEADER 000D00EB]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 000D00EC]
Tell me again about Alamut...

[HEADER 000D00ED]
It is the home of the Old Man of the Mountains.

[HEADER 000D00F0]
Have you ever seen this old manuscript before?

[HEADER 000D00F1]
You know what it is, don't you?

[HEADER 000D00F2]
You are in great danger.

[HEADER 000D00F3]
Put the manuscript back and leave here.

[HEADER 000D00F4]
What's going on?

[HEADER 000D00F5]
I can say no more.

[HEADER 000D00F6]
Why is this manuscript so important?

[HEADER 000D00F7]
I cannot say.

[HEADER 000D00FF]
What does this clown's nose suggest to you?

[HEADER 000D0100]
In my country, we have no use for clowns.

[HEADER 000D0101]
I'm glad to hear it.

[HEADER 000D0102]
They were dealt with most severely in the last cultural cleansing.

[HEADER 000D0103]
What about the mimes? Did you get them, too?

[HEADER 000D0104]
All gone. Our streets are mime free.

[HEADER 000D0105]
It sounds like heaven...

[HEADER 000D0106]
You don't care for clowns, do you?

[HEADER 000D0107]
They belong in the circus - like fleas and bearded women.

[HEADER 000D0108]
Do you recognize this man?

[HEADER 000D0109]
He calls himself  `Khan'.

[HEADER 000D010A]
Yes, I know this man.

[HEADER 000D010B]
Why do you carry his photograph?

[HEADER 000D010C]
I'm a private detective.

[HEADER 000D010D]
This is a photo of Khan, right?

[HEADER 000D010E]
That is just one of the names by which he is known.

[HEADER 000D00EE]
Does this goo-smeared tissue mean anything to you?

[HEADER 000D00EF]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 000D00F8]
Do you recognise this key?

[HEADER 000D00F9]
No, I do not.

[HEADER 000D00FA]
May I shake you by the hand?

[HEADER 000D00FB]
I do not shake the hands of Imperialist dogs.

[HEADER 000D00FC]
That's a real bad attitude problem you've got there.

[HEADER 000D00FD]
Do you recognize this card?

[HEADER 000D00FE]
No, I do not.

[HEADER 000D00E0]
Thanks for your help...

[HEADER 000D00E1]
Goodbye.

[HEADER 000F0000]
A small cabinet stood beside the bed.

[HEADER 000F0001]
The cabinet was empty, but it smelt of onions. No kidding, it really did.

[HEADER 000F0002]
Telephone.

[HEADER 005A00A6]
No reply!

[HEADER 005A00A7]
Maybe she's busy developing her photographs...

[HEADER 000F0003]
It was a massive mahogany wardrobe...

[HEADER 000F0004]
There was nothing in the wardrobe apart from a vague lingering smell of camphor.

[HEADER 000E0000]
The sign on the door read twenty-one.

[HEADER 000E0001]
Maybe it wasn't the right room, but this was the right key...

[HEADER 000E0004]
The door was locked...

[HEADER 000E0003]
If the tailor's description was correct, this was the killer's room.

[HEADER 000E0002]
The sign on the door read twenty-two.

[HEADER 000E0005]
It wasn't the right key for the door...

[HEADER 00110000]
The bed was several times larger than the narrow cot I'd been given at the place I was staying.

[HEADER 00110001]
The bed was freshly made, and the crisp white sheets told me nothing about the killer's habits....

[HEADER 005A00A5]
Hmm...

[HEADER 00110002]
It was the battered leather briefcase I'd seen Plantard carrying just before he died...

[HEADER 00110003]
I searched the interior of the briefcase but, as I'd half expected, it was empty.

[HEADER 00110004]
The cabinet had no drawers, just a single door.

[HEADER 00110005]
The assassin had been too smart to leave incriminating evidence beside his bed...

[HEADER 00110006]
The door led back into the hall.

[HEADER 0013010D]
It was Khan.

[HEADER 00110007]
I had the kind of feeling in my stomach that would usually send me running to the bathroom.

[HEADER 000007D0]
As Khan opened the wardrobe I was sure I was dead...

[HEADER 000007D1]
...but he grabbed his pants quickly and didn't even see me.

[HEADER 000007D2]
I didn't usually spy on men getting changed...

[HEADER 000007D3]
...but this guy was a killer and I didn't want any surprises.

[HEADER 000007D4]
He left his chequered pants on the bed!

[HEADER 0011000F]
The closet was a solid, impressive piece of antique furniture.

[HEADER 00110008]
The pants were newly laundered and pressed with immaculate creases.

[HEADER 00110009]
There was nothing in the pockets of the pants.

[HEADER 0011000A]
The pants matched the jacket which the killer had lost in Paris...

[HEADER 0011000E]
There was nothing else in the pockets of the killer's pants.

[HEADER 000C0005]
If the manuscript was what Flap and Guido were after, they were going to be disappointed.

[HEADER 000C0006]
I couldn't wait to get back to Nico's apartment and check it out...

[HEADER 00001932]
I couldn't leave the hotel with the manuscript.

[HEADER 00001933]
It was probably what those thugs were looking for...

[HEADER 00100001]
I knew this was no way to treat an ancient manuscript.

[HEADER 00100002]
I couldn't let it fall into the hands of the goons waiting outside, though.

[HEADER 00100000]
I resisted a childish desire to toss things from a height.

[HEADER 00100004]
The cobbles of the alleyway looked very distant and very hard.

[HEADER 0000183F]
I couldn't do that...

[HEADER 000018A3]
I flipped the pants over...

[HEADER 000018AE]
I turned the pants over again...

[HEADER 0000189E]
There was no bulge in the pocket.

[HEADER 0000189C]
I had that kind of feeling you only get from searching still-warm pants.

[HEADER 0000189D]
The pocket was empty.

[HEADER 000018A0]
I wondered if the guy was colour blind...

[HEADER 0000189F]
There was nothing in the pocket.

[HEADER 000018A1]
A strip along the side seam of the pants had been unpicked...

[HEADER 000018A2]
...then sewn back up with strong thread and a special stitch.

[HEADER 000018B1]
The thread had gone; the seam was now a secret pocket.

[HEADER 000018AF]
I searched the pocket gingerly and found a pass card.

[HEADER 000018B0]
It read: `Thomas Moerlin, Grüber Electronics Corporation'.

[HEADER 0000189B]
There was nothing else in the secret pocket.

[HEADER 000018AA]
A thread was hanging loose near the pocket.

[HEADER 000018A9]
It looked like there could be something in this pocket.

[HEADER 000018A6]
I found an ordinary matchbook. No matches; no clues.

[HEADER 000018A7]
But as I pulled it from the pocket a strong thread came with it...

[HEADER 000018A8]
...a thread with a metal tag on the end.

[HEADER 000018A5]
I tried not think that the assassin's butt had just been in here.

[HEADER 000018A4]
I found nothing in the pocket.

[HEADER 000018AD]
A metal tag was attached to the thread that had been tucked in the pocket...

[HEADER 000018AB]
I pulled on the metal tag and the thread came out of the pants.

[HEADER 000018AC]
It was like pulling out a rip-cord.

[HEADER 000D000B]
It was the register of guests staying at the hotel.

[HEADER 000D000C]
There was no-one registered under the name of Khan...

[HEADER 000D000D]
If the killer was staying here, he'd used a different pseudonym.

[HEADER 000D000E]
But the name in the book for room twenty two was Moerlin.
