The window is far too high to reach.

[HEADER 000030DE]
The statue has rungs - vaguely like a ladder.

[HEADER 000030E8]
You'll need to release the statue.

[HEADER 000030F2]
Unhook both wires, and then push the statue against the wall.

[HEADER 000030FC]
Imelda's dead - what should I do?

[HEADER 00003106]
Around her neck is a locket - what secret could it hold?

[HEADER 00003110]
Open the locket and take the key.

[HEADER 00002337]
Now I'd got this far, I wasn't giving up. I had to find a way in.

[HEADER 00002331]
It was held in place by wires. Hmm, maybe it wasn't art after all. Maybe it was a cellphone transmitter?

[HEADER 00002332]
People say "what's the point of modern art". I say - isn't it obvious?

[HEADER 00002333]
If I could deconstruct this I could deconstruct anything.

[HEADER 00002330]
Fixed tight. Presumably to stop critics stealing it. Who else would want to?

[HEADER 00002338]
It was a long way down.

[HEADER 00002336]
Definitely an improvement. Now the piece really spoke to me. I think it said: I have fallen over.

[HEADER 00000045]
Uh... no.

[HEADER 0000232C]
A hairclip to pick a high security lock? It might work in a movie, but not for me...

[HEADER 0000232A]
Carchon's front door. There was a fresh scratch on the paint.

[HEADER 0000251E]
The kind that's left when someone's picked the lock...

[HEADER 0000232B]
If I was right - Imelda was getting a lesson from a mime artist.

[HEADER 0000251F]
And it wasn't the old moving staircase routine...

[HEADER 00002329]
Hmm. Locked. No way was I going to break through a door like this.

[HEADER 00002328]
I arrived to find the Palais Royale courtyard deserted. I only hoped that I had beaten the assassin here.

[HEADER 0000251D]
I had to warn Imelda before it was too late.

[HEADER 0000235F]
A door bell.

[HEADER 0000232F]
A button - which didn't work...

[HEADER 0000232D]
The intercom system wasn't working.

[HEADER 0000232E]
Bad sign. Somebody had cut the wire...

[HEADER 00002335]

[HEADER 00002334]
Just your average modern art retaining wire.

[HEADER 0000238E]
I released the second wire...

[HEADER 0000238C]
Even with both wires removed the statue remained upright...

[HEADER 0000238D]
I unhooked the first wire...

[HEADER 0000233C]
The window had been repaired with industrial plastic sheeting.

[HEADER 0000233B]
The plastic sheet was thick and strong - I'd need more than my hands to tear it.

[HEADER 00002339]
If only I could get up to the window...

[HEADER 0000233A]
That broken window looked like the best way in.

[HEADER 0000233D]
Now that's what I call modern art.

[HEADER 0000233E]
My God. I'm too late.

[HEADER 0000233F]
Imelda. Oh no...

[HEADER 00002340]
Nico...?

[HEADER 00002341]
Don't worry, you're going to be all right.

[HEADER 00002342]
You know that isn't true.

[HEADER 00002343]
It was Moerlin, wasn't it?

[HEADER 00002344]
Dressed as a cavalier. How absurd!

[HEADER 00002345]
You came to warn me, didn't you?

[HEADER 00002346]
I must be crazy.

[HEADER 00002347]
Let me see you, Nicole...

[HEADER 00002348]
All this time you were just using me. Which one is the real Imelda?

[HEADER 00002349]
You are an extraordinary girl. Thierry would have been so proud of you.

[HEADER 0000234A]
You didn't know my father -

[HEADER 0000234B]
So like him... something about the eyes... I wish we'd had time to get to know each other -

[HEADER 0000234C]
She was gone. She'd cheated me, lied to me, used me. But why?

[HEADER 0000234D]
The killer had escaped into the night.

[HEADER 0000234E]

[HEADER 0000235D]
Even in death Imelda looked the same. Beautiful. Inscrutable. The Ice Queen alone in her Ice Palace.

[HEADER 0000235B]
Around her neck was a locket.

[HEADER 0000235C]
I opened it - inside was a tiny gold key.

[HEADER 0000235E]
I had to leave. I knew I could never return.

[HEADER 0000234F]
The Carchons in happier days. Well, before they were both assassinated, at least.

[HEADER 00002356]
A beautiful fireplace - though I doubt the Carchons used to cuddle up in front of it with a TV dinner.

[HEADER 00002357]
Climbing up the fireplace would be futile.

[HEADER 00002358]
I really had better things to do.

[HEADER 0000235A]
I was pretty sure the killer had gone.

[HEADER 00002521]
And unless he'd brought the next costume with him I was safe for the time being.

[HEADER 00002359]
No point in leaving without checking for clues. I was learning fast - every stiff has a silver lining.

[HEADER 00002360]
I took the key.
