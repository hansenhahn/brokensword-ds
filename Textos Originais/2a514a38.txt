[HEADER 00004358]
There's a hole in the rock, but how do I get down there?

[HEADER 00004362]
You need to improvise a rope ladder.

[HEADER 0000436C]
Grab the branch from the tree. You'll need to tie something rope-like to it.

[HEADER 00004376]
Tie the towel to the branch.

[HEADER 00004380]
Wedge the branch and towel into the hole, and climb down.

[HEADER 0000438A]
I seem to be stuck halfway down a cliff.

[HEADER 00004394]
Take a look around for any suspicious openings.

[HEADER 0000439E]
See the hole in the back wall? Take a closer look.

[HEADER 000043A8]
Reach into the hole and give the ring a tug.

[HEADER 000043B2]
There's a corpse here. And I'm trapped. What should I do?

[HEADER 000043BC]
Do what you always do when you find a corpse. Search it.

[HEADER 000043C6]
Take a closer look at his jacket.

[HEADER 000043D0]
Move the jacket to one side to find the lens.

[HEADER 000043DA]
I've got the lens, but there doesn't seem to be a way out of here.

[HEADER 000043E4]
There's an inscription on the wall and a strange statue. Take a closer look at them.

[HEADER 00360003]
A young tree grew at the edge of the drop.

[HEADER 00360004]
I'd damaged that tree enough for one day.

[HEADER 00360005]
Centuries of hot days and cold nights had opened a crack in the cliff edge...

[HEADER 00360006]
...deep into the living rock.

[HEADER 00360007]
I could see that crack would make a good anchor point.

[HEADER 00360020]
Well, that looked really safe but I had no choice.

[HEADER 00360021]
I hadn't anticipated going mountaineering when I'd come to Syria.

[HEADER 00360016]
The ring had done the trick, all right.

[HEADER 00360008]
Close up, the niche looked somehow artificial.

[HEADER 00360012]
I took a firm hold of the ring....

[HEADER 00360013]
...tried not to think of death traps...

[HEADER 00360014]
...and pulled.

[HEADER 00360015]
Woah there!

[HEADER 00360009]
I didn't like the idea of putting my hand in there...

[HEADER 0036000A]
But, hey! What the heck! I was only risking mutilation.

[HEADER 0036000B]
No blade took my hand off at the wrist...

[HEADER 0036000C]
...and no scorpion stung me, for which I was very grateful...

[HEADER 0036000D]
...but there WAS something in there...

[HEADER 0036000E]
...a metal ring, as wide as my hand.

[HEADER 0036001B]
I got that `Go on, jump. It'll be fun!' feeling you sometimes get at a cliff edge.

[HEADER 0036001C]
If I managed to land on the truck without hitting a support, I might even survive it.

[HEADER 0036001D]
If I'd been a little bit younger and a whole bunch more stupid, I might have gone for it.

[HEADER 00360018]
This country sure was beautiful. I'd have to visit again some time when I wasn't in such a hurry..

[HEADER 00360019]
Down below I could see the top of Ultar's soft top truck...

[HEADER 0036001A]
...it seemed a hell of a long way down.

[HEADER 00360027]
A secret door. All I needed now...

[HEADER 00360028]
...was Vincent Price to loom up out of the dark for my day to be complete.

[HEADER 00370000]
Around the corner I found the corpse.

[HEADER 00370001]
Oh, my God! Klausner?

[HEADER 00370002]
Large as life and twice as dead.

[HEADER 00370003]
I'd hardly had time to accept the fact when I heard the door mechanism start up again.

[HEADER 00370004]
Aw, man! No!

[HEADER 00370005]
The door had slammed shut, trapping me.

[HEADER 00370006]
I had a bad feeling about how Klausner had died.

[HEADER 0037000B]
I couldn't help but notice...

[HEADER 0037000C]
...faint bloody finger marks on the rock...

[HEADER 0037000D]
...as if somebody had tried to claw their way out.

[HEADER 00370007]
I examined the door carefully, high...

[HEADER 00370008]
...and low.

[HEADER 00370009]
I looked for levers and rings to pull, panels and buttons to push like in the movies...

[HEADER 0037000A]
.... and found nothing.

[HEADER 0037002F]
A stone head bearing three bearded faces.

[HEADER 00370030]
It was a strange image but a powerful one...

[HEADER 00370031]
...redolent with antiquity and ancient mysteries.

[HEADER 00370034]
The mouth's opening! It must be Ultar!

[HEADER 00370035]
My God! If he comes in we'll both be trapped!

[HEADER 00370036]
ULTAR! DON'T COME IN! IT'S A TRAP!

[HEADER 00370037]
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

[HEADER 00370038]
You!

[HEADER 00370039]
Hello, Mr. Stobbart. We meet in the most unusual places.

[HEADER 0037003A]
Please do not make any sudden moves. I have no desire to maim you.

[HEADER 0037003B]
Did you say `maim'?

[HEADER 0037003C]
I did. Dead men tell no tales, as you say...

[HEADER 0037003D]
...and I want to hear everything that you have to tell me.

[HEADER 0037003E]
And what if I don't want to talk?

[HEADER 0037003F]
Then I shall, most regrettably, have to kill you.

[HEADER 00370040]
Rest assured, however, that I am an excellent shot. You would not suffer.

[HEADER 00370041]
That's good. Believe me, I'm really assured.

[HEADER 00370042]
It is rather dark in here. I think we should conduct our business outside.

[HEADER 00370043]
Why should I make myself an easier target?

[HEADER 00370044]
If I fire at you, Mr Stobbart, I shall hit you - even in here.

[HEADER 00370045]
But, unfortunately, my marksmanship will suffer.

[HEADER 00370046]
It could be the difference between hitting you in the leg...

[HEADER 00370047]
...or the groin.

[HEADER 00370048]
Boy, it sure is hot in here!

[HEADER 00370049]
No sudden moves, Mr Stobbart.

[HEADER 00370033]
I couldn't think of anything to do with the statue, apart from scaring small children with it.

[HEADER 00370026]
Up on the wall was an inscription, partially eroded by the ages.

[HEADER 00370027]
Something, something, `In occidenta sita est in ora mundi'.

[HEADER 00370028]
The Latin was clear enough...

[HEADER 00370029]
... but what did it mean?

[HEADER 0037002A]
I couldn't take the inscription with me...

[HEADER 0037002C]
All I could do was stare at it and try to memorize it.

[HEADER 0037002D]
`In occidenta sita est in ora mundi'. Okay.

[HEADER 0037002E]
That would have to do.

[HEADER 00360029]
Now, then. Where shall we start?

[HEADER 0036002A]
How about being bosom buddies and you putting that gun away?

[HEADER 0036002B]
Klausner. Do you know where he is?

[HEADER 0036002F]
Klausner? Who the hell's Klausner?

[HEADER 00360030]
I followed his trail here as, I believe, did you.

[HEADER 00360031]
I never heard of this Klausner guy before.

[HEADER 00360032]
I just asked around about strangers and got lucky.

[HEADER 00360033]
Luck is a commodity that you are sorely pressed for now, Mr. Stobbart.

[HEADER 00360034]
I have been watching you since you arrived in Marib.

[HEADER 00360035]
You have? I never noticed you.

[HEADER 00360036]
Precisely my point. You don't know what I know.

[HEADER 00360037]
Please bear this in mind when answering my next questions.

[HEADER 00360038]
Now, where is Klausner?

[HEADER 0036002C]
Yeah, he's dead, just around the corner of the cave. Do you want to look?

[HEADER 0036002D]
I'll take your word for it. How did he die?

[HEADER 0036002E]
Starvation or dehydration by the look of it.

[HEADER 0036003F]
He was caught in this trap you were shouting about?

[HEADER 00360040]
Hmmm, I suspected as much. The Templars were not ones to give away their secrets lightly.

[HEADER 00360041]
Was he carrying anything of importance?

[HEADER 0036003C]
I'm telling you, I've never heard of the man and I don't know where he is!

[HEADER 00360087]
Maybe we can cut a deal?

[HEADER 00360047]
What is to stop me killing you anyway?

[HEADER 0036004F]
Was there anything else?

[HEADER 0036003D]
Now if you're going to kill me, just get it over with because I've got a full itinerary.

[HEADER 0036003E]
Very well.

[HEADER 00360089]
No, nothing.

[HEADER 0036008A]
So why is this location important? What did the Templars hide here if not an artefact?

[HEADER 00360042]
Yeah, he was carrying some sort of lens. I've got it here.

[HEADER 00360043]
Give it to me.

[HEADER 00360044]
No, I don't think so.

[HEADER 00360045]
Don't be a fool, Mr. Stobbart.

[HEADER 00360046]
If I give it to you, what's to stop you killing me?

[HEADER 00360048]
You might hit the lens.

[HEADER 00360049]
Not if I shoot you in the head.

[HEADER 0036004A]
When I fall, the lens might get broken.

[HEADER 0036004B]
Hmmm.

[HEADER 0036004C]
You plead convincingly, Mr. Stobbart.

[HEADER 0036004D]
Perhaps you will live to see another day.

[HEADER 0036004E]
Perhaps.

[HEADER 00360039]
Okay. He's dead, just around the corner of the cave. Do you want to look?

[HEADER 0036003A]
I shall trust you on that. How did he die?

[HEADER 0036003B]
Starvation or dehydration by the look of it.

[HEADER 0036008B]
Well, there was something in Latin up on the wall.

[HEADER 0036008C]
Latin? Do you remember it, Mr. Stobbart?

[HEADER 0036008D]
What did it say?

[HEADER 0036008E]
`In occidenta sita est, in ora mundi '.

[HEADER 0036008F]
Ah, the words of Caesar! Yes, that makes sense!

[HEADER 00360090]
Well, I know that, roughly, it means, `to the West, to the edge of the world.'

[HEADER 00360091]
But what the heck is that about?

[HEADER 00360092]
It tells me where the Sword of Baphomet lies.

[HEADER 00360093]
Mr. Stobbart. I am sure that you are just what you appear to be...

[HEADER 00360094]
...a gifted amateur.

[HEADER 00360095]
Thanks.... I think.

[HEADER 00360096]
But I can no longer tolerate your interference.

[HEADER 00360097]
There is far more at stake than you realize.

[HEADER 00360098]
So what are you going to do?

[HEADER 00360099]
I regret that we must end this here and now.

[HEADER 0036009A]
Your only choice now is whether you die like a man or like a dog.

[HEADER 0036006C]
Well, there is something, I guess, but you can't move it.

[HEADER 0036006D]
Yes? What is it?

[HEADER 0036006E]
It's a treasure map. X marks the spot?

[HEADER 0036006F]
Come now. Do you expect me to believe that?

[HEADER 00360070]
Yeh, okay. You caught me.

[HEADER 00360071]
'Round the corner, there's something in Latin up on the wall.

[HEADER 00360072]
Latin? Do you remember it, Mr. Stobbart?

[HEADER 00360073]
`In occidenta sita est, in ora mundi'.

[HEADER 00360074]
Ah, the words of Caesar! Yes, that makes sense!

[HEADER 00360075]
Well, I know that, roughly, it means, `to the West, to the edge of the world.'

[HEADER 00360076]
But what the heck is that about?

[HEADER 00360077]
It tells me where the Sword of Baphomet lies.

[HEADER 00360078]
Mr. Stobbart. I am sure that you are just what you appear to be...

[HEADER 00360079]
...a gifted amateur.

[HEADER 0036007A]
Thanks... I think.

[HEADER 0036007B]
But I can no longer tolerate your interference.

[HEADER 0036007C]
There is far more at stake than you realize.

[HEADER 0036007D]
So what are you going to do?

[HEADER 0036007E]
I regret that we must end this here and now.

[HEADER 0036007F]
Your only choice now is whether you die like a man or like a dog.

[HEADER 00360086]
Hey, look now! Don't kill me! I've got money!

[HEADER 00360088]
You disappoint me.

[HEADER 00360080]
Okay, you're the boss. I'll take my medicine.

[HEADER 00360082]
I should like to shake your hand.

[HEADER 00360081]
You are an honourable man, Mr. Stobbart, a rare breed.

[HEADER 00360083]
Yeah, well. What the heck.

[HEADER 00001900]
Hold on - it's not every day a guy gets to die...

[HEADER 00001901]
Give me a minute to prepare myself...

[HEADER 00001902]
I needed a plan but was desperately running out of time.

[HEADER 00001903]
Don't I get a last meal...?

[HEADER 000018BA]
The pocket was empty.

[HEADER 000018BB]
The smell of the corpse reminded me of something...

[HEADER 000018BC]
Hmm. It was my favourite Brie back in Paris.

[HEADER 0000183F]
I couldn't do that...

[HEADER 00370019]
I've done more fun things in my life than searching a corpse...

[HEADER 0037001A]
...but as my life expectancy wasn't great, I figured I should try every new challenge that came my way.

[HEADER 000018BD]
I cautiously flicked open the jacket.

[HEADER 000018B7]
Whatever had been in the bottle had been drunk.

[HEADER 000018B8]
Klausner must have died of thirst and dehydration.

[HEADER 000018B9]
The bottle was empty.

[HEADER 00370013]
...I couldn't see any marks of violence.

[HEADER 00370014]
Apart from his finger tips being scraped raw...

[HEADER 00370015]
...and that seemed self-inflicted.

[HEADER 00370016]
Klausner had been pretty smart to get this far...

[HEADER 00370017]
...but he was still dead.

[HEADER 000018C0]
Klausner was dead alright...

[HEADER 000018B5]
I searched the corpse...

[HEADER 00370021]
No portable phone, no demolition charges, no five course meal.

[HEADER 00370022]
You'd think international conspirators would go around better equipped.

[HEADER 000018B6]
I'd searched Klausner once - there was nothing on his body.

[HEADER 000018B2]
Bullwhips might be handy for exploring ancient ruins...

[HEADER 000018B3]
...but they're no use when you're trapped in a cave.

[HEADER 000018B4]
Klausner clearly fancied himself as a latter-day Indiana Jones.

[HEADER 000018C1]
So much for whips. They're all show.

[HEADER 000018BE]
A leather pouch was tucked behind Klausner's body.

[HEADER 0037001B]
Hey? What's this?

[HEADER 0037001C]
I'd found some kind of lens...

[HEADER 0037001D]
...a very old lens made from a very hard glass.

[HEADER 0037001E]
That settled it.

[HEADER 0037001F]
The knight on the manuscript had been holding a lens the whole time, not a crystal ball.

[HEADER 000018BF]
There was nothing else in the pouch.
