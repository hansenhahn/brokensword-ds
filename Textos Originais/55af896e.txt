[HEADER 00009C68]
What do I do now I'm in the church?

[HEADER 00009C72]
You need to get that door open. Take a good look around at everything.

[HEADER 00009C7C]
Pull apart that mechanism with the large wheel to get a cog and handle, and search through that pile of rubbish until you can't find anything more.

[HEADER 00009C86]
What do I do with all this junk?

[HEADER 00009C90]
Take a close look at the gargoyle.

[HEADER 00009C9A]
See the holes. What could you put in there?

[HEADER 00009CA4]
Put the cogs in each eye and the handle in his mouth. Now turn the handle.

[HEADER 008103AA]
I'd feel happier if we had a gun or something.

[HEADER 008103AB]
Khan gave me something.

[HEADER 008103AC]
What?

[HEADER 008103AD]
His handbag.

[HEADER 008103AE]
Great. If we run into any killers, we can give them a good buffeting.

[HEADER 008103AF]
Didn't he have any weapons?

[HEADER 008103B0]
You don't know the half of it. This bag's full of C-4!

[HEADER 008103B1]
Wow! Why didn't you say so?

[HEADER 008103B2]
Boy, we'll show them now!

[HEADER 008103B3]
What's C-4?

[HEADER 008103B4]
Plastique, George.

[HEADER 008103B5]
We're going to shop our way to victory?

[HEADER 008103B6]
Two kilos of plastic explosive. The detonator's broken though.

[HEADER 008103B7]
No problem. We'll buy a box of matches somewhere.

[HEADER 008103B8]
It doesn't work that way. It takes a small explosion to start the big explosion.

[HEADER 008103B9]
Well that's not much use then.

[HEADER 008103BA]
What does that sign say?

[HEADER 008103BB]
Apparently, during the English Civil War in the mid-seventeenth century...

[HEADER 008103BC]
...this place was used as an arms dump.

[HEADER 008103BD]
Yeah? What happened?

[HEADER 008103BE]
Look at the state of this place, George. You work it out.

[HEADER 008103BF]
Stray spark?

[HEADER 008103C0]
You've got it. The tower was the only thing to survive the blast.

[HEADER 008103C1]
I hope the explosion didn't destroy the Sword of Baphomet!

[HEADER 008103C2]
Do you? I rather hope it did.

[HEADER 0048002A]
I scrabbled around in the rubble and found an old clay pipe with a broken stem.

[HEADER 0048002B]
Under one of the stones I found a metal coin which was green with age.

[HEADER 0048002C]
It was caked with soil, but what I'd found was a small cog and spindle.

[HEADER 0048002D]
With mounting excitement I felt something between my fingers.

[HEADER 0048002E]
It was short, hard and black, something I hadn't expected to find here...

[HEADER 0048002F]
It was a plastic pen top.

[HEADER 00480030]
I didn't find anything.

[HEADER 00480003]
The handle turned easily and the larger wheel began to revolve...

[HEADER 00480004]
Damn!

[HEADER 00480005]
Then the handle came off in my hand.

[HEADER 00480006]
Now that the handle was gone it was easy to remove the cog and spindle.

[HEADER 00480022]
With a rasp of metal on stone I eased the second eye into place.

[HEADER 00480021]
The cog slipped neatly into the eye socket.

[HEADER 00480020]
I pushed the handle into the demon's mouth - the cogs all meshed. I began to turn...

[HEADER 00480023]
With the clay pipe in his mouth he looked happy, homely, like somebody's grand-daddy.

[HEADER 008103C3]
What do you think you're doing, George?

[HEADER 008103C4]
I wondered if there was a secret mechanism in the demon's mouth.

[HEADER 008103C5]
Maybe you should show a little more respect...

[HEADER 008103C6]
For a mythical medieval demon? Give me a break!

[HEADER 008103C7]
Okay. Go right ahead. Meddle with forces you don't understand.

[HEADER 008103C8]
Incur the demon's wrath and burn in hell...

[HEADER 008103C9]
Just see if I care...

[HEADER 00480024]
Sometimes the most childish gestures can have a cathartic effect...

[HEADER 00480025]
The transformation of the demon to a clown did just that for me.

[HEADER 0048001F]
I tried turning the cogs but couldn't move them. I needed a mechanical advantage.

[HEADER 0048001E]
The cog turned freely, but nothing happened.

[HEADER 00480019]
Examining the demon more closely, I realized something about its face.

[HEADER 0048001A]
It was a clever illusion - no matter where I stood, the eyes weren't looking at me.

[HEADER 0048001B]
There was a simple reason: the demon didn't have any eyes.

[HEADER 0048001C]
I ran my fingers across the cold stone and probed the holes in the demon's eyes.

[HEADER 0048001D]
Beneath them the mouth formed another hole - but I wasn't about to put my finger in there.

[HEADER 00480031]
Above the carved cross was an indecipherable inscription.

[HEADER 00480032]
For all I knew it could have been scribed in Gaelic.

[HEADER 00480033]
I tried pushing the panel but wasn't surprised when it failed to move.

[HEADER 00490000]
As soon as I saw the flickering torches I realized the bogus Templars had beaten us to the Sword.

[HEADER 00490001]
But where were they now, and why was it so quiet?

[HEADER 0081039A]
No, George!

[HEADER 0081039B]
What?

[HEADER 0081039C]
Leave that torch right where it is.

[HEADER 0081039D]
In case you haven't noticed, the crypt is full of gunpowder.

[HEADER 0081039E]
So what? Don't you trust me?

[HEADER 0081039F]
It's not a question of trust...

[HEADER 008103A0]
No? You think I'm a jerk, don't you?

[HEADER 008103A1]
Don't be silly, George. And keep your voice down.

[HEADER 008103A2]
I thought I heard something... like chanting.

[HEADER 00490003]
I really wasn't worried about the danger of igniting the gunpowder...

[HEADER 00490004]
But Nico's temper was likely to flare up again. Now that scared me!

[HEADER 008103A3]
Listen!

[HEADER 008103A4]
I can definitely hear chanting.

[HEADER 008103A5]
You're right. I hear it too.

[HEADER 008103A6]
What do you suppose they're doing?

[HEADER 008103A7]
It wouldn't surprise me if they were holding some kind of satanic sex ritual...

[HEADER 008103A8]
So what are we waiting for?

[HEADER 008103CA]
Nico?

[HEADER 008103CB]
Uh-huh?

[HEADER 008103D1]
What are you doing?

[HEADER 008103D2]
Committing this inscription to memory...

[HEADER 008103D3]
Can you read it?

[HEADER 008103D4]
No.

[HEADER 008103D5]
What's the point of studying the inscription if you can't read it?

[HEADER 008103D6]
Because it could be important - a clue to whatever we're looking for, who knows?

[HEADER 008103D7]
I might find someone in Stirling to translate it.

[HEADER 008103D8]
We don't have time to go looking for a linguist!

[HEADER 008103D9]
No? At least I'm doing something positive.

[HEADER 008103DA]
What language is that inscription written in?

[HEADER 008103DB]
You're the languages student. You tell me.

[HEADER 008103DC]
It's looks like Ancient Norse. Maybe.

[HEADER 008103DD]
Perhaps it's in code?

[HEADER 008103DE]
I don't think so...

[HEADER 008103DF]
Norse code?

[HEADER 008103CC]
It looks like the Templars got here first.

[HEADER 008103CD]
We might not be too late. There's still a chance.

[HEADER 008103CE]
I wish I had your optimism...

[HEADER 008103CF]
So do I, George.

[HEADER 008103D0]
Sometimes you're so negative.

[HEADER 00490014]
Come on, Nico! We're leaving!

[HEADER 00490015]
You fools! You cannot escape us!

[HEADER 00490016]
Guido! Stop them!

[HEADER 00490017]
But, master, the powder!

[HEADER 00490018]
That powder is from the English Civil War, you fool!

[HEADER 00490019]
It's over three hundred years old! How explosive do you think it can be?

[HEADER 0049001A]
I thought it was all over but Nico had one last trick up her sleeve...

[HEADER 0049001B]
...or in her handbag to be exact.

[HEADER 0049001C]
A handbag full of plastic explosives!

[HEADER 0049001D]
Maybe, but this stuff's brand new!

[HEADER 00000A94]
We didn't stay long in Scotland.  George had a vacation to finish.

[HEADER 00000A95]
And I had another story to write.  Not the real story of course -

[HEADER 00000A96]
but enough half-truths to fill a page and pay my rent for the month.

[HEADER 00000A97]
George and I hung out together in Paris.

[HEADER 00000A98]
I showed him my favourite restaurants and he told me his best jokes.

[HEADER 00000A99]
You know, Nico... This city holds so many memories for me now.  The cafes, the music...

[HEADER 00000A9A]
The sewers -

[HEADER 00000A9B]
Tell me about it. The clowns -

[HEADER 00000A9C]
The jugglers -

[HEADER 00000A9D]
Oh, and your pal Lobineau...

[HEADER 00000A9E]
Yes, dear André.

[HEADER 00000A9F]
When we first met, and I was doing my detective stuff - you kinda disappeared a lot, Nico.

[HEADER 00000AA0]
Were you and Lobineau...? er...?

[HEADER 00000AA1]
There was something... happening.  But nothing to do with André.

[HEADER 00000AA2]
Uh huh...

[HEADER 00000AA3]
It was something from the past that I had to deal with.  On my own.

[HEADER 00000AA4]
So I dealt with it.  And now it's over.

[HEADER 00000AA5]
Oh.  Well... hey! That's good. In fact - that's great!

[HEADER 00000AA6]
Because it had nothing to do with André?

[HEADER 00000AA7]
What?  Oh. No!   I mean - it's great that it's over.  Great that you're happy. Er.

[HEADER 00000AA8]
More wine?

[HEADER 00000AA9]
Thanks George.

[HEADER 00000AAA]
Hey, did I ever tell you about the old Irish couple and the lottery?

[HEADER 00000AAB]
No.  But I think you're going to...

[HEADER 00000AAC]
There's this old Irish couple.

[HEADER 00000AAD]
They've been married forever - like fifty years, and they win the lottery.

[HEADER 00000AAE]
And they think, what are we going to do?

[HEADER 00000AAF]
They give some money away, but they decide to have themselves a holiday in Paris.

[HEADER 00000AB0]
So they fly off to Paris, first class.

[HEADER 00000AB1]
They stay in a beautiful hotel, and one day they go up the Eiffel Tower.

[HEADER 00000AB2]
They get all the way up to the top and find themselves up there alone with two hippies.

[HEADER 00000AB3]
The two hippies have long hair, beards, long robes.

[HEADER 00000AB4]
As they're looking at them, suddenly one of the hippies gets up on top of the guard rail and jumps.

[HEADER 00000AB5]
Just before he hits the ground he waves his arms and flies all the way back up again.

[HEADER 00000AB6]
The couple have never seen anything like this before in their lives. They can't believe what they have just seen.

[HEADER 00000AB7]
The hippy had just jumped off, just before he hit the ground he flapped his arms and up he came.

[HEADER 00000AB8]
They walk over to him and say 'excuse me Sir, Good God, how did you do that?'

[HEADER 00000AB9]
'It's really easy, man, it's really easy. You jump, empty your mind...

[HEADER 00000ABA]
'... and just before you hit the pavement, you waive your arms and up you come.

[HEADER 00000ABB]
'Here, I'll show you how to do it again.'

[HEADER 00000ABC]
Just before he hits the pavement, he raises his arms and up he comes again. The couple can't believe it.

[HEADER 00000ABD]
'Come on you can try it, man. You come on up. You'll be fine. You can do it.'

[HEADER 00000ABE]
So the old fellow and the old lady get up there.

[HEADER 00000ABF]
And they say 'So when we jump, we'll go all the way down, and just before - we flap our arms...'.

[HEADER 00000AC0]
'You come straight back up again - it's really easy. Go ahead give it a try.'

[HEADER 00000AC1]
The old Irish couple jump. Just before they hit the pavement they start flapping their arms.

[HEADER 00000AC2]
Nothing. Bang. Irish stew on the pavement. It's all over.

[HEADER 00000AC3]
One hippie, who hasn't said a word, turns to the other and say:

[HEADER 00000AC4]
'You know Gabriel, for an Archangel, you can be a real son of a bitch.'

[HEADER 004A002F]
I swear... I just wanted things to be right...

[HEADER 004A0030]
Take them. Kill them.

[HEADER 004A0031]
They will not escape.

[HEADER 00490010]
Okay, okay! Let me think!

[HEADER 00490011]
George!

[HEADER 00490012]
Stay away from me!

[HEADER 00490013]
So perish all enemies of the New Templar Order!

[HEADER 00490008]
Well, well!

[HEADER 00490009]
If it isn't the great detective and his beautiful assistant.

[HEADER 0049000A]
It's going to be a pleasure killing the pair of you.

[HEADER 0049000B]
George! What are we going to do?

[HEADER 004A0000]
Will you look at that!

[HEADER 004A0001]
Baphomet! Lobineau was right, this place was ancient even to the Templars!

[HEADER 004A0002]
This whole place... this is Baphomet!

[HEADER 004A0003]
Finally, the truth.

[HEADER 004A0004]
The Templars had never worshipped this graven image, no more than they'd worship a rainbow.

[HEADER 004A0005]
But, like a rainbow they regarded it as a symbol of a covenant with God, who'd revealed this place to them.

[HEADER 004A0006]
Rosso! Why the double-dealing, treacherous...!

[HEADER 004A0007]
On the contrary!

[HEADER 004A0008]
Inspector Rosso has been the model of obedience, an important quality in a true Templar.

[HEADER 004A0009]
Now be quiet and watch if you wish to live much longer.

[HEADER 004A0011]
Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here to witness the reforging of the sword that was broken!

[HEADER 004A0012]
Here, before God's sentinel! Baphomet!

[HEADER 004A0013]
Grand Master and Knight of Baphomet...

[HEADER 004A0014]
We salute and pledge our obedience to you.

[HEADER 004A0015]
I salute you, Gatekeeper of the Temple.

[HEADER 004A0016]
Seven centuries ago our greatest weapon, the Sword of Baphomet, was lost to us.

[HEADER 004A0017]
Now, we prepare to reforge it to wield against new enemies.

[HEADER 004A0018]
As the tired millennium dies and this world looks for new leaders, we shall not fail.

[HEADER 004A0019]
We shall lead the people to a new order wherein all borders will dissolve.

[HEADER 004A001A]
All will be united under the red cross of the Templars!

[HEADER 004A001B]
George. We have watched your efforts to stop us with respect.

[HEADER 004A001C]
But surely you realize that you have been misled by our enemies?

[HEADER 004A001D]
Both of us want a better world.

[HEADER 004A001F]
Fortunately, no harm has been done.

[HEADER 004A0020]
We need determined, resourceful men like you.

[HEADER 004A0021]
Join us, George. Join us in true brotherhood...

[HEADER 004A0022]
Yeah... true - wait?

[HEADER 004A0023]
Brothers? What about Marquet?

[HEADER 004A0024]
What about Peagram and Klausner?

[HEADER 004A0025]
You didn't look on them as brothers, only as failures!

[HEADER 004A0026]
Three men dead and you don't give a damn!

[HEADER 004A0027]
George, you know that sacrifices are necessary.

[HEADER 004A0028]
Every great undertaking...

[HEADER 004A0029]
Save it for these... these mindless sheep!

[HEADER 004A002A]
And what about those whose faces don't fit?

[HEADER 004A002B]
Join you? I'll see you in Hell first!

[HEADER 004A002C]
Ah, George. I had great hopes for you.

[HEADER 004A002D]
C'est la guerre. Eklund, kill him.

[HEADER 004A002E]
I never thought this was what they'd want.

[HEADER 00001E46]
The cog wouldn't fit that hole...

[HEADER 00001E53]
The cogs all meshed. It began to turn...

[HEADER 00001E48]
That wasn't the hole the handle was meant to fit into...

[HEADER 00001E4A]
I was sure the clay pipe wasn't meant to fit there.

[HEADER 00001E4C]
The red nose had nothing to grip onto.

[HEADER 00000040]
Uh... no.

[HEADER 00001E47]
It wasn't the right hole for that cog...

[HEADER 00001E49]
The handle didn't fit in there...

[HEADER 00001E4B]
The clay pipe wasn't meant to fit in that hole.

[HEADER 00001E4D]
There was nothing the nose could attach to.

[HEADER 00000042]
Hmm... No way.

[HEADER 00001E4E]
The cog wouldn't fit the demon's nose.

[HEADER 00001E4F]
Trying to fit the handle up the demon's nose would have taken all day...

[HEADER 00001E50]
It was no good - the demon wasn't inhaling.

[HEADER 00001E51]
I couldn't insert the handle - the clay pipe was in the way.

[HEADER 00001E52]
I pushed the handle into the demon's mouth...

[HEADER 00000041]
Hmm... Maybe not.

[HEADER 00001934]
Come on, George! Think of something.

[HEADER 00001935]
What do you suggest?

[HEADER 00001936]
Well, this place is full of explosives...

[HEADER 00001937]
What about that torch?

[HEADER 00001938]
What about it?

[HEADER 00001939]
Just grab it and throw it at the explosives!
