[HEADER 00002A76]
George has survived the explosion. What should I do now?

[HEADER 00002A80]
Search the debris for clues.

[HEADER 00002A8A]
There's a newspaper blown against a lamppost outside the café. Pick it up and read all the articles.

[HEADER 00002A94]
How do I follow the clown?

[HEADER 00002A9E]
In the alleyway you will find a manhole cover - to lift it, you'll need the right tool for the job.

[HEADER 00002AA8]
There's a workman around the corner - there may be something useful in his toolbox.

[HEADER 00002AB2]
He'll need distracting. What do you have that might interest him?

[HEADER 00002ABC]
Give the workman the newspaper - the tip will have him racing off.

[HEADER 00002AC6]
The gentleman with whiskers won't take me seriously.

[HEADER 00002AD0]
You need to give him the impression you're worth talking to.

[HEADER 00002ADA]
Show him the inspector's card. Now talk to him about the material, and then the jacket.

[HEADER 00002ADC]
I've got a lot of information - I just wish I'd asked Nico for her phone number!

[HEADER 00002ADE]
Maybe she gave her phone number to the police?

[HEADER 00002AE0]
Go talk to the policeman guarding the café - he will give you her number.

[HEADER 00002AE4]
I know about the killer's suit - what about Nico?

[HEADER 00002AEE]
Nico may be impressed by your detective work - you should try phoning her.

[HEADER 00002EE0]
You will find a phone next to the workman's tent.

[HEADER 00002EEA]
How do I get into the café?

[HEADER 00002EF4]
Try chatting to the workman after he stops you walking into the café - flatter him.

[HEADER 00002EFE]
Sneak through the door while he's preening himself.

[HEADER 00002F08]
I'm sure there's something I'm supposed to find in the café.

[HEADER 00002F12]
You need to reflect on the crime for a bit.

[HEADER 00002F1C]
Move the mirror and see what you can see.

[HEADER 00002F26]
Look at the mirror and you'll see an item wedged behind some pipes. Now you've seen it, you can walk to it and pick it up.

[HEADER 00002F30]
I can't leave the area. What else should I do?

[HEADER 00002F3A]
That bag you found. What's inside?

[HEADER 00002F44]
Examine the contents, and decrypt the note.

[HEADER 00002F46]
I'm having difficultly decrypting this note.

[HEADER 00002F48]
Who was the note addressed to?

[HEADER 00002F4A]
The first word is 'Plantard'. The word Pierre appears several times - notice with other words start with the letter 'P'.

[HEADER 00010008]
The leading article referred to the visit of a Nobel prize winner from some unpronounceable Eastern European State.

[HEADER 00010007]
Wrapped around the lamp post was a newspaper.

[HEADER 00030000]
The pretty young waitress was unconscious.

[HEADER 00030001]
The waitress was clearly suffering from shock...

[HEADER 00030035]
Hey, wake up!

[HEADER 00030034]
She didn't respond. If I wanted another cappuccino, I'd have to serve myself.

[HEADER 0003000A]
Oh, my head. Never again!

[HEADER 0003000B]
How much vodka did I drink? No, don't tell me!

[HEADER 0003000C]
What is your name, cheri?

[HEADER 0003000D]
George Stobbart, ma'am!

[HEADER 0003000E]
Oh... American?

[HEADER 0003000F]
She asked the question quite innocently, but I could sense her reserve.

[HEADER 00030010]
It was something which seemed to afflict all Europeans...

[HEADER 00030011]
You look like you could use a little help...

[HEADER 00030012]
I could use a little drink!

[HEADER 00030013]
I feel sick, dizzy, and bruised - and I don't even remember the party!

[HEADER 00030014]
Just relax and take it easy. You've been knocked out...

[HEADER 00030015]
You don't say! What happened?

[HEADER 00030016]
There's been an explosion. You should try not to move.

[HEADER 00030017]
Are you a doctor?

[HEADER 00030018]
Yes, I am. I studied under Doctor Benton.

[HEADER 00030019]
Who is he?

[HEADER 0003001A]
Only one of the most brilliant medical minds on this planet.

[HEADER 0003001B]
He taught me everything I know about medicine.

[HEADER 0003001C]
No, but I used to play hospitals when I was a kid...

[HEADER 0003001D]
Can you remember anything at all?

[HEADER 0003001E]
Non. I need a drink. Pour me a brandy.

[HEADER 0003001F]
Is that straight, or with ice?

[HEADER 00030020]
Just give me the bottle with a teat on it.

[HEADER 00030021]
I guess a little drop won't hurt.

[HEADER 00030022]
Ah! That's better.

[HEADER 00030023]
She knocked back the brandy as if it was water.

[HEADER 00030024]
I was glad I wasn't picking up the check!

[HEADER 00030025]
You could be in shock. No alcohol.

[HEADER 00030026]
Okay - you're the doctor.

[HEADER 00030027]
What about the old man - is he dead?

[HEADER 00030029]
Yes, he is.

[HEADER 0003002A]
Ah, mon Dieu!

[HEADER 0003002B]
I've never seen a real live corpse before, except for grande-maman.

[HEADER 0003002C]
That was different - she was family.

[HEADER 0003002D]
Has he... gone stiff?

[HEADER 0003002E]
I shouldn't think so. He's only been dead a few minutes.

[HEADER 00030031]
I don't know. I haven't looked at him yet.

[HEADER 0003002F]
Of course not.

[HEADER 00030030]
I didn't want an hysterical French girl on my hands - at least, not right now...

[HEADER 00030038]
Do you remember what happened when the clown entered?

[HEADER 00030039]
I remember that horrible tune he played all right!

[HEADER 0003003A]
It was like a funeral dirge!

[HEADER 0003003B]
I'd never liked accordion music, either.

[HEADER 0003003C]
Did the clown speak to the old man?

[HEADER 0003003D]
No - he just laughed at him.

[HEADER 0003003E]
Then he grabbed the old man's briefcase and ran out the door.

[HEADER 0003003F]
Did the old man try to stop the clown?

[HEADER 00030040]
Oh, he didn't have a chance.

[HEADER 00030041]
The clown dropped his accordion and ran out of the door.

[HEADER 00030042]
That's it. That's all I can remember.

[HEADER 00030047]
Did you know the old man?

[HEADER 00030048]
No, m'sieur, I never saw him before.

[HEADER 00030049]
How did the old man behave?

[HEADER 0003004A]
Well... agitated. He kept looking about him - at the door, at his watch...

[HEADER 0003004B]
As if he was waiting for someone?

[HEADER 0003004C]
Yes, I suppose so. He was worried about something, that's for sure.

[HEADER 0003004D]
If you ask me, he was having an affair.

[HEADER 0003004E]
He had that look about him... like a guilty husband.

[HEADER 00030043]
Did you see what the old man had in his briefcase?

[HEADER 00030044]
No. He didn't open it.

[HEADER 00030045]
What did the old man do when the clown snatched his briefcase?

[HEADER 00030046]
Nothing. He just sat there, like he was frozen.

[HEADER 00030051]
Did this newspaper belong to the old gentleman?

[HEADER 00030052]
I don't know.

[HEADER 00030053]
Someone has scribbled a note on it.

[HEADER 00030054]
It reads: `Salah-eh-Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'

[HEADER 00030055]
Does that mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00030056]
Non, m'sieur, nothing.

[HEADER 0003004F]
Stay here, ma'moiselle.

[HEADER 00030050]
I'm going to look around for evidence...

[HEADER 0002000D]
It was an iron cover concealing the entrance to a drain or sewer...

[HEADER 00020011]
I lifted the cover to reveal what smelt like the entrance to a sewer.

[HEADER 00020010]
The cover was too heavy and awkward to lift with my bare hands.

[HEADER 00040004]
It was a battered metal toolbox.

[HEADER 00040011]
Hé, stop that! Get away from there!

[HEADER 00040012]
What d'you think you're doing?

[HEADER 00040013]
I was... admiring your toolbox.

[HEADER 00040014]
Ah, oui? Had a good look, have you?

[HEADER 00040015]
I'm warning you - if you touch it I'll crack your nut!

[HEADER 00040016]
Okay! I get your point...

[HEADER 00040006]
I'd found just what I wanted - a tool for lifting manhole covers.

[HEADER 00040005]
I found a T-shaped tool in the box. I didn't know what it was, but it looked useful...

[HEADER 00060001]
It was a shiny red plastic ball, sat incongruously on the slippery, green-slimed floor.

[HEADER 00060002]
As I picked up the plastic ball, I realized it was intended to be worn.

[HEADER 00060003]
It was the clown's red nose.

[HEADER 00040000]
The muscular workman wore a morose expression like a silent warning to leave him to get on with his job...

[HEADER 0004002C]
Hey, you!

[HEADER 0004002E]
I thought you'd been arrested?

[HEADER 0004002F]
No. It was a misunderstanding.

[HEADER 00040030]
When he pulled that gun - cah! - I thought that was it.

[HEADER 00040031]
Those automatics pack quite a punch, you know.

[HEADER 00040032]
He made a mistake. He thought I was a terrorist.

[HEADER 00040033]
You? A terrorist? Ha!

[HEADER 00040034]
He was only doing his duty, I guess.

[HEADER 0004002D]
Hi! Can you spare a few minutes?

[HEADER 00040035]
What do you want now?

[HEADER 00040036]
Did you see a clown come by this way?

[HEADER 00040037]
A clown? Like in a circus?

[HEADER 00040038]
Yeah. With make-up and a big red nose.

[HEADER 00040039]
Ho! Those guys are funny, aren't they?

[HEADER 0004003A]
Not in my experience.

[HEADER 0004003B]
I love the circus - especially the horses.

[HEADER 0004003F]
You haven't answered my question.

[HEADER 00040040]
Have you seen a clown?

[HEADER 00040041]
You think I've got time to watch everyone who passes by?

[HEADER 00040042]
Some of us have to work for a living.

[HEADER 00040043]
Look, I know you're busy, but surely you'd have noticed a clown?

[HEADER 00040044]
I told you already, I didn't see a thing!

[HEADER 00040045]
He was wearing multicoloured baggy trousers and make-up!

[HEADER 00040046]
He'd be a poor sort of clown if he didn't...

[HEADER 00040047]
Listen - I have to find that clown. He's a killer.

[HEADER 0004004A]
Say, who are you anyhow? A cop?

[HEADER 0004004B]
No, of course not. Do I look like a cop?

[HEADER 0004004C]
Non, but you act like one, sticking your nose in where it's not wanted...

[HEADER 0004004E]
How do you know this guy's a killer? Did you see him in action?

[HEADER 0004004F]
Didn't you hear the explosion? The café was blown up!

[HEADER 00040050]
I wondered what that bang was...! Any bodies?

[HEADER 00040051]
Yeah. An old man was killed.

[HEADER 00040052]
Merde! I didn't think it was that serious. What about the waitress?

[HEADER 00040053]
Oh, she's fine.

[HEADER 00040054]
Thank the saints!

[HEADER 00040048]
Why would I want to help the cops?

[HEADER 00040049]
Community spirit. Together we can combat crime and stuff.

[HEADER 0004005A]
Did you see an old guy with a briefcase?

[HEADER 0004005B]
Oui. Silly old coot! D'you know what he said to me?

[HEADER 0004005C]
"Work fascinates me," he says. "I could watch it all day."

[HEADER 0004005D]
Quelle bitte! I could have knocked his block off!

[HEADER 0004005E]
Did you recognize the old man?

[HEADER 0004005F]
Non. Should I have done? Was he a celebrity?

[HEADER 00040060]
No, but I guess he is now.

[HEADER 00040063]
Was he the one who died in the café?

[HEADER 00040064]
Yeah.

[HEADER 00040065]
That's too bad.

[HEADER 00040066]
Now I wish I hadn't called him what I did.

[HEADER 00040067]
If only I could turn back the clock! If only I'd been more tolerant!

[HEADER 00040068]
Regret and remorse are strange emotions...

[HEADER 00040069]
They really bring out the hammiest actors in people.

[HEADER 00040061]
His name was Plantard.

[HEADER 00040062]
Was? He's dead, then?

[HEADER 0004006A]
What's in the toolbox?

[HEADER 0004006B]
What's in the toolbox! As if you didn't know!

[HEADER 0004006C]
What's the big deal about tools, anyhow?

[HEADER 0004006D]
They're cool. Tools are Civilization!

[HEADER 0004006E]
You don't say?

[HEADER 0004006F]
That's right. Tools are what distinguish us from other animals.

[HEADER 00040070]
Who are you calling an animal? I've met your sort before!

[HEADER 00040071]
Looking down your nose at me because I'm working class, huh?

[HEADER 00040072]
I've a good mind to knock your block off!

[HEADER 00040073]
What kind of tools d'you keep in your box?

[HEADER 00040074]
Hein? You really ARE interested in tools?

[HEADER 00040075]
Sure! Like I said - tools are...

[HEADER 00040076]
Yeah - civilization - so you keep saying.

[HEADER 00040077]
So - are you going to show them to me?

[HEADER 00040078]
Am I... why, you...!

[HEADER 00040079]
Aw, c'mon! Just a little peek?

[HEADER 0004007A]
I've got work to do. Find someone else to bother.

[HEADER 0004007B]
Do you have a tool for lifting manhole covers?

[HEADER 0004007C]
As it happens, I do.

[HEADER 0004007D]
Cool! Lend it to me - just for a few minutes!

[HEADER 0004007E]
Non.

[HEADER 0004007F]
Aw, c'mon...

[HEADER 00040080]
Non! Get your own.

[HEADER 00040081]
Let me explain what I'm going to do with your manhole-lifting tool...

[HEADER 00040082]
Let me explain what I'm going to do with my pick.

[HEADER 00040083]
Oh - hey! Forget it. I'll come back when you're in a better mood.

[HEADER 00040084]
It doesn't get any better than this!

[HEADER 000400A9]
Take a look at this...

[HEADER 000400AA]
You told me you weren't a cop!

[HEADER 000400AC]
Don't shout about it. I'm working under cover.

[HEADER 000400AD]
Who are you looking for?

[HEADER 000400AE]
That's confidential.

[HEADER 000400AB]
Aie! You're a cop?

[HEADER 00040087]
Would you like to read my newspaper?

[HEADER 00040088]
I haven't got time to read that! Can't you see I'm busy?

[HEADER 00040089]
You could read it on your lunch break...

[HEADER 0004008A]
Ten minutes is all I get, and if my boss had his way, I wouldn't get that!

[HEADER 0004008B]
He'd have me on a drip so I didn't have to stop to eat!

[HEADER 0004008C]
Oh, take the newspaper and quit complaining.

[HEADER 0004008D]
Pah! Look at this! Damned bleeding-heart liberals!

[HEADER 0004008E]
Tchah! Save the dolphins? Catch them and eat them, I say!

[HEADER 0004008F]
All that fuss over a bunch of fish!

[HEADER 00040090]
Now that's more like it! Look at the size of those!

[HEADER 00040091]
Like champagne bottle corks, non?

[HEADER 00040092]
AH! What's this? Salah-eh Dinn - running in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe!

[HEADER 00040093]
It's a race horse?

[HEADER 00040094]
A horse? A legend! Bucephalus reborn, mon ami!

[HEADER 00040095]
Like a streak of lightning, she is!

[HEADER 00040096]
Do me a favor won't you? Keep an eye on my hole...

[HEADER 00040097]
I'm off to put some money on that nag!

[HEADER 00040098]
What about your toolbox?

[HEADER 00040099]
Stuff it! Help yourself!

[HEADER 0004009A]
Does this matchbook mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0004009B]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 0004009C]
Does the name Moerlin mean anything to you?

[HEADER 0004009D]
No, nothing.

[HEADER 0004009E]
What do you make of this clown's nose?

[HEADER 0004009F]
It would be more amusing if you were wearing it.

[HEADER 000400A0]
Do you recognize the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 000400A1]
No, I don't.

[HEADER 000400A2]
Do you recognize this tissue?

[HEADER 000400A3]
Certainly not!

[HEADER 000400A4]
I borrowed this tool from you while you were gone...

[HEADER 000400A5]
Keep it! I can afford to buy a new set now.

[HEADER 000400A6]
Would you like to shake hands with me?

[HEADER 000400A7]
No, I wouldn't.

[HEADER 000400A8]
One of the real pleasures of being rich is not having to be polite.

[HEADER 00040085]
I gotta go.

[HEADER 00040086]
Don't let me keep you...

[HEADER 00010009]
That was the only news story: the rest was rumour, gossip and sensationalism.

[HEADER 0001000A]
Then I noticed the writing at the foot of the page...

[HEADER 0001000B]
It read: `Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'

[HEADER 000400B1]
Freeze! Hold it right there!

[HEADER 000400B2]
Woah - don't shoot! I'm innocent! I'm an American!

[HEADER 000400B3]
Can't make up your mind, huh?

[HEADER 000400B4]
I demand to see the American Consul!

[HEADER 000400B5]
Drop your weapons and get down on the ground!

[HEADER 000400B6]
Put that thing away, Sergeant Moue.

[HEADER 000400B7]
I apologize, m'sieur, but I cannot permit you to leave.

[HEADER 000400B8]
Am I under arrest?

[HEADER 000400B9]
Ah, non! I would simply like to ask you some questions.

[HEADER 000400BA]
En avant - to the café! Marche!

[HEADER 00030059]
What a mess! This bombing is an outrage, is it not?

[HEADER 0003005A]
Stop that, m'sieur!

[HEADER 0003005C]
Has it occurred to you that he may be dead, Moue...?

[HEADER 0003005D]
Oui, m'sieur, but I prefer to look on the bright side...

[HEADER 0003005E]
Besides, I recall a case where the killer escaped by feigning death!

[HEADER 0003005F]
However, in this case the man is quite dead.

[HEADER 00030069]
Examine the girl, and take her statement... if you can.

[HEADER 0003006F]
Et maintenant, to business!

[HEADER 00030070]
Your name, please?

[HEADER 00030071]
George Stobbart. I'm from California.

[HEADER 00030072]
And what brings you to Paris, m'sieur Stobbart?

[HEADER 00030073]
Travel. I'm touring Europe.

[HEADER 00030074]
You chose well. The city is most beautiful at this time of year, non?

[HEADER 00030075]
Uh... yeah, I guess so - apart from the bomb blasts!

[HEADER 00030076]
Were you in the vicinity of the café at the time of the explosion?

[HEADER 00030077]
Yeah. I was sitting out on the sidewalk.

[HEADER 00030078]
I was lucky I wasn't killed!

[HEADER 00030079]
The Inspector passed over my remark with no reaction...

[HEADER 0003007A]
Did you see the deceased enter the café?

[HEADER 0003007B]
Yes, I did.

[HEADER 0003007C]
Was he alone?

[HEADER 0003007D]
Uh... yeah.

[HEADER 0003007E]
And did he say anything to you?

[HEADER 0003007F]
No. He was more interested in the waitress.

[HEADER 00030080]
No.

[HEADER 00030081]
Did you see anyone else in the café?

[HEADER 00030087]
I'm sorry, Inspector, I didn't.

[HEADER 00030088]
It never ceases to amaze me how unobservant the public can be!

[HEADER 00030082]
Yeah, there was a guy dressed as a clown.

[HEADER 00030083]
He was carrying an accordion.

[HEADER 00030084]
An accordion?

[HEADER 00030085]
Bon. The picture is forming in my mind...

[HEADER 00030086]
And it is not a pretty one!

[HEADER 00030089]
Is the girl all right, Moue?

[HEADER 0003008A]
She'll live...

[HEADER 0003008B]
If she survives the hangover.

[HEADER 00030095]
She says the American claimed to be a doctor.

[HEADER 00030096]
He forced her to drink the brandy...

[HEADER 00030097]
I can explain everything!

[HEADER 00030098]
Can you, m'sieur?

[HEADER 00030099]
Almost everything.

[HEADER 000300A0]
She doesn't remember seeing a clown, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000300A1]
That's odd, don't you think, m'sieur?

[HEADER 000300A2]
Who am I to believe, I wonder?

[HEADER 0003008C]
She says the killer was disguised as a clown.

[HEADER 0003008D]
A circus clown? Did you see him, m'sieur?

[HEADER 0003008E]
Oh, yeah! Now you come to mention it, there WAS a clown.

[HEADER 0003008F]
I didn't think much of it at the time. After all, this is Paris...

[HEADER 00030090]
I see you come well armoured with preconception.

[HEADER 00030091]
Let us hope that your sheath does not turn out to be your shroud.

[HEADER 0003009B]
Oui? You did not tell me you were a doctor, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0003009C]
Uh, no. That's right. I didn't think it was relevant.

[HEADER 0003009A]
She confirms the doctor's statement.

[HEADER 0003009D]
She confirms the American's statement.

[HEADER 0003009E]
A clown with an accordion, no doubt an elaborate and eccentric disguise.

[HEADER 0003009F]
Very well.

[HEADER 000300A3]
Eh bien. I have heard enough.

[HEADER 000300A4]
What do you mean?

[HEADER 000300A5]
I am satisfied that you know nothing. You may leave.

[HEADER 000300A7]
Enjoy your vacation, Doctor Stobbart...

[HEADER 000300A6]
I hope this little incident does not spoil the rest of your vacation...

[HEADER 000300A8]
What about my personal safety? Can't you at least give me some advice?

[HEADER 000300A9]
What can I say? Stay alert, and look out for suspicious characters...

[HEADER 000300AA]
And don't cross the road until the little man shows green.

[HEADER 000300AB]
Great advice.

[HEADER 000300AC]
I honestly believe you are in no danger, m'sieur.

[HEADER 000300AD]
Should you remember anything of importance, please contact me.

[HEADER 000300AE]
My card...

[HEADER 000300AF]
Thanks.

[HEADER 000300B0]
That is all. You may go.

[HEADER 000300B1]
There's not much to go on, m'sieur...

[HEADER 000300B2]
On the surface, no. But what lurks inside the subconscious?

[HEADER 000300B3]
If the door can only be opened...

[HEADER 000300B4]
Are you serious, m'sieur? I thought your interest in psychic detection was purely academic...

[HEADER 000300B5]
Academic? You are about to witness a scientific breakthrough!

[HEADER 000300B6]
The practical application of years of study!

[HEADER 000300B7]
I'd feel more comfortable if you'd suggested we rough her up a bit!

[HEADER 00030002]
It was the body of the old man.

[HEADER 00030003]
It was hard to believe I'd seen him alive only minutes before...

[HEADER 00030007]
I checked his pockets. Nothing.

[HEADER 00030004]
The sight of the dead guy's staring eyes turned my knees to jelly...

[HEADER 00030005]
I tried not to meet his stare as I searched the dead man's pockets.

[HEADER 00030006]
No wallet, no papers, no credit cards. The guy's past was a blank page.

[HEADER 00030008]
A mysteriously undamaged bottle of spirits stood on the bar.

[HEADER 00030009]
I needed a stiff drink, but I hated the taste of brandy.

[HEADER 00010004]
The Sergeant was a scrawny man in his fifties who resembled a constipated chicken.

[HEADER 00910001]
Excuse me, sergeant...

[HEADER 00910011]
What do you want now?

[HEADER 00910002]
Sergeant Moue?

[HEADER 0091000C]
Ah! Monsieur Stobbart, n'est-ce pas?

[HEADER 0091000D]
That's correct. You remember me!

[HEADER 0091000E]
The retention of such data is part of my duty as a gendarme.

[HEADER 0091000F]
That is how crime is fought; through attention to detail, not intuition.

[HEADER 00910010]
Yeah, sure.

[HEADER 00910060]
What is Rosso doing with that girl?

[HEADER 00910061]
He is `giving her the once over' as you Americans say.

[HEADER 00910063]
Once he gets his teeth into a case, nothing will shake him off.

[HEADER 00910012]
Did you notice the young woman who was here earlier?

[HEADER 00910013]
The girl with the camera? Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910014]
She works for one of the newspapers.

[HEADER 00910015]
Did you see where she went?

[HEADER 00910016]
She has gone home to develop her snapshots.

[HEADER 00910017]
She took one of me, you know.

[HEADER 00910018]
She said mine was the kind of face that makes great pictures!

[HEADER 00910019]
She did?

[HEADER 0091001A]
Ouais! I have great depth of character, that's what she told me.

[HEADER 0091001B]
Did she leave her address?

[HEADER 0091001C]
No, m'sieur. But I have her telephone number...

[HEADER 0091001D]
Fifty, forty-eight, twenty-six, seventeen.

[HEADER 0091001E]
Thanks.

[HEADER 0091001F]
She said to call her in a few days when the photographs are ready.

[HEADER 00910020]
I thought I'd take the best shot of me and use it for personalized Christmas cards!

[HEADER 00910021]
Great idea, sergeant. I'm sure your family and friends will be astounded.

[HEADER 00910022]
I was one of the last people to see the victim alive, sergeant.

[HEADER 00910023]
Does that worry you?

[HEADER 00910024]
Yes, it does. I feel I kinda... owe it to him, to find his killer.

[HEADER 00910025]
That is best left to the authorities, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910026]
Did he speak to you, tell you anything?

[HEADER 00910027]
No. He just grinned and nodded.

[HEADER 00910028]
Don't let it trouble you, m'sieur. Go home and try to forget.

[HEADER 00910029]
I know the identity of the dead guy! His name was Plantard.

[HEADER 0091002A]
Is that so? You knew him, did you?

[HEADER 0091002B]
No - but...

[HEADER 0091002C]
We'll know everything there is to know about him, soon enough.

[HEADER 0091002D]
I'm trying to be helpful here!

[HEADER 0091002E]
The best way you can help us is to go home, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0091002F]
I have a confession to make, Sergeant.

[HEADER 00910030]
I really did see the clown.

[HEADER 00910031]
He ran into the alley across the street.

[HEADER 00910032]
Why did you not tell this to Inspecteur Rosso?

[HEADER 00910033]
I didn't want to sound foolish...

[HEADER 00910034]
And you did not want to become involved, no?

[HEADER 00910035]
Do not worry. It is of no consequence.

[HEADER 00910036]
I will inform m'sieur l'Inspecteur when he has finished with the girl.

[HEADER 00910037]
Did you follow him?

[HEADER 00910038]
I lost him. I figure he went under ground.

[HEADER 00910039]
Do you know how many kilometres of sewers there are beneath this great city?

[HEADER 0091003A]
It's not a question I've lost sleep over...

[HEADER 0091003B]
I have no doubt that Inspecteur Rosso will organize a proper search.

[HEADER 00910040]
I've tracked down the clown's movements, sergeant!

[HEADER 00910041]
Is that so, m'sieur?

[HEADER 00910042]
Yeah. There's a man down the street who saw him crawling out of the sewer!

[HEADER 00910043]
Dressed as a clown?

[HEADER 00910044]
No - he'd changed into ordinary clothes by then.

[HEADER 00910045]
So how did he know it was the clown?

[HEADER 00910046]
He didn't, but all the clues add up.

[HEADER 00910047]
Little children can add up, but I wouldn't let them manage my bank account...

[HEADER 009100B3]
Did I show you this newspaper...?

[HEADER 009100B4]
Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100A7]
I found this in the street, Sergeant.

[HEADER 009100A8]
That, m'sieur, is a newspaper, no?

[HEADER 009100A9]
There's a note written on it - `Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty five.'

[HEADER 009100AE]
Ah - ha!

[HEADER 009100AF]
That's stumped you, hasn't it?

[HEADER 009100B0]
I have never been stumped - as you put it - in my life, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100B1]
It is the name assumed by the clown, no?

[HEADER 009100B2]
Salah-eh Dinn the clown...? I don't think so.

[HEADER 009100BD]
Are you sure you don't want this false nose?

[HEADER 009100BE]
Don't try my patience, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100B5]
I found this red nose in the sewer.

[HEADER 009100B6]
What were you doing down there?

[HEADER 009100B7]
Fishing for clues. That's where the clown went.

[HEADER 009100B8]
You still insist you saw a clown, m'sieur?

[HEADER 009100B9]
Of course - and this novelty nose proves it!

[HEADER 009100BA]
It will take more than a plastic proboscis to convince Inspecteur Rosso!

[HEADER 009100BB]
You don't want this as evidence, then?

[HEADER 009100BC]
Certainly not, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009100EA]
Did I show you this material, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100EB]
Yes, m'sieur. It is horrible.

[HEADER 009100E3]
I believe this material came from the clown's clothing.

[HEADER 009100E4]
If you are right, m'sieur, then the clown must be an Englishman.

[HEADER 009100E5]
How do you figure that?

[HEADER 009100E6]
Only the English would wear a suit made from material like that.

[HEADER 009100E7]
Don't you like the English?

[HEADER 009100E8]
It is not so much a question of liking, rather one of taste.

[HEADER 009100E9]
They have none.

[HEADER 009100C6]
I've got Inspector Rosso's address card...

[HEADER 009100C7]
Yes, m'sieur. You showed me before...

[HEADER 009100BF]
Look, sergeant - the Inspector gave me his card...

[HEADER 009100C0]
Yes, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100C1]
He wants you to advise him if you have any information concerning this case.

[HEADER 009100C2]
I'd be glad to talk with him, but I don't want him working his psycho weirdness on me.

[HEADER 009100C3]
Ah, no, m'sieur. You are confusing the science of parapsychology with witchcraft.

[HEADER 009100C4]
Oh, yeah? What's the difference?

[HEADER 009100C5]
We don't do sacrifices.

[HEADER 009100D8]
Did I show you my tool, Sergeant?

[HEADER 009100D9]
Yes, m'sieur - unfortunately you did.

[HEADER 009100CD]
What do you suppose this tool is used for, Sergeant Moue?

[HEADER 009100CE]
It looks like something an obstetrician would use, m'sieur...

[HEADER 009100CF]
It was with tools like this that the clown made his escape!

[HEADER 009100D0]
I don't understand...

[HEADER 009100D1]
He opened up the hole and disappeared into the bowels of the earth!

[HEADER 009100D2]
If you say so, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100D3]
I don't think so. I found it in that workman's toolbox.

[HEADER 009100D4]
Found it? I hope you did not steal it, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009100D5]
Do I look like a common thief?

[HEADER 009100D6]
He asked me to look after his hole, and his belongings.

[HEADER 009100D7]
You certainly know how to enjoy your vacation to the fullest, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100EC]
Do you recognize this dirty tissue?

[HEADER 009100F2]
I told you - no, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009100ED]
No, m'sieur, I do not.

[HEADER 009100EE]
I found it in the sewer...

[HEADER 009100EF]
Perhaps It would be better if you put it back there...

[HEADER 009100F0]
No way! This could be an important clue.

[HEADER 009100F1]
If you say so, m'sieur.

[HEADER 00910091]
See you later, sergeant.

[HEADER 00010005]
The girl presented a confident but sullen mask to the world, an expression more suited to the face of a delinquent youth.

[HEADER 0081002E]
Excuse me, mademoiselle.

[HEADER 008101D8]
Hi! My name's George Stobbart...

[HEADER 008101D9]
Oh. An American, by the sound of it.

[HEADER 008101DA]
Yeah. That's right. On vacation in Paris.

[HEADER 008101DB]
Some vacation, huh?

[HEADER 008101DC]
You were here when the bomb went off?

[HEADER 008101DD]
Sure was! Sat right out front of the café!

[HEADER 008101DE]
Did you notice a middle-aged man, maybe sixty, with a hat and overcoat?

[HEADER 008101DF]
I couldn't believe it. She hadn't even asked how I was feeling...

[HEADER 008101E0]
Yeah. He went inside, just before the bomb exploded.

[HEADER 008101E1]
You weren't... related to him were you?

[HEADER 008101E2]
Oh, no - nothing like that.

[HEADER 008101E3]
I'm Nicole Collard, from 'La Liberté'.

[HEADER 008101E4]
What is that - some kind of nightclub?

[HEADER 008101E5]
Ah, no - it's a newspaper.

[HEADER 008101E6]
You're a reporter?

[HEADER 008101E7]
I'm a freelance photo-journalist.

[HEADER 008101E8]
Say - you could interview me about the bombing!

[HEADER 008101E9]
An eye-witness account...

[HEADER 008101EA]
`Minutes after the outrage that shook the whole of Paris...'

[HEADER 008101EB]
You know - real life drama, human interest - that kind of stuff.

[HEADER 008101EC]
I'll just stick to the facts, thank you.

[HEADER 008101ED]
Did you see who planted the bomb?

[HEADER 008101EE]
I know it sounds crazy, but he was dressed like a clown!

[HEADER 008101EF]
A clown? It's him again...

[HEADER 0081002F]
Hey, Nico!

[HEADER 008101F0]
What is it?

[HEADER 00810246]
Have you met the clown before?

[HEADER 00810247]
It's... a long story.

[HEADER 00810248]
I have plenty of time.

[HEADER 00810249]
I don't.

[HEADER 0081024A]
Why won't you tell me about this clown?

[HEADER 0081024B]
Why do you want to get involved?

[HEADER 0081024C]
Because he almost killed me! Isn't that reason enough?

[HEADER 0081024D]
I guess so. Listen...

[HEADER 0081024E]
I'll give you my phone number.

[HEADER 0081024F]
You help me with my story, and I'll let you in on what I know.

[HEADER 00810250]
And let's get one thing straight right now...

[HEADER 00810251]
This is strictly business.

[HEADER 00810252]
Okay. It's a deal.

[HEADER 00810253]
I have to go develop these pictures. À bientôt, m'sieur...

[HEADER 00810254]
Fine. I'll, uh... see you soon.

[HEADER 00810237]
Who was the guy you were supposed to meet?

[HEADER 00810238]
His name was Plantard. I didn't know him, but he called me last night.

[HEADER 00810239]
He said he had a story which would interest me.

[HEADER 0081023A]
He asked me to meet him at the café.

[HEADER 0081023B]
I guess I'll never know what he wanted to tell me...

[HEADER 0081023C]
Not unless you have Rosso's gift for psychic interrogation.

[HEADER 0081023D]
How did Plantard get your name?

[HEADER 0081023E]
Through the newspaper - La Liberté.

[HEADER 0081023F]
I'd written an article linking two unsolved murders, one in Italy, the other in Japan.

[HEADER 00810240]
The cases were remarkably similar...

[HEADER 00810241]
...a wealthy victim, no apparent motive, and a costumed killer.

[HEADER 00810242]
Plantard said he could supply me with more information.

[HEADER 00810243]
Somehow, the clown must have known about our appointment!

[HEADER 0081020C]
You speak very good English for a French girl...

[HEADER 0081020D]
Thanks. You speak very good English for an American.

[HEADER 008101F9]
Do you know a police officer called Rosso?

[HEADER 008101FA]
Rosso? Our paths have a knack of crossing.

[HEADER 008101FB]
If I didn't know better I'd say it was deliberate.

[HEADER 008101FC]
Have you seen Rosso? Is he here?

[HEADER 008101FD]
He's inside, attempting to question a witness with his psychic powers!

[HEADER 008101FE]
What? That guy is weird!

[HEADER 008101FF]
Yeah.

[HEADER 00810200]
Rosso didn't blink when I told him about the clown.

[HEADER 00810201]
It's as if he already knew...

[HEADER 00810202]
That's typical of a cold fish like Rosso.

[HEADER 00810203]
I've seen cheeseburgers with more spunk.

[HEADER 0081034E]
Look - the Inspector gave me his card.

[HEADER 00810352]
I didn't know his first name was Augustin! It suits him, I must say.

[HEADER 0081034F]
Rosso!

[HEADER 00810350]
You know him?

[HEADER 00810351]
Oh, yes. We've met.

[HEADER 008102F7]
I found this newspaper outside the café.

[HEADER 008102F8]
That's not a newspaper - it's a gossip rag!

[HEADER 008102F9]
It may have belonged to Plantard.

[HEADER 008102FA]
So - he had a taste for sensationalist smut with a right-wing bias?

[HEADER 008102FB]
That doesn't tell us much.

[HEADER 008102FC]
There's something written in it...

[HEADER 008102FD]
`Salah-eh-Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'

[HEADER 008102FE]
Sounds like a betting tip  - the name of a horse and the time of the race.

[HEADER 008102FF]
What do you think?

[HEADER 00810300]
That's what I thought, but the name of the meeting isn't given.

[HEADER 00810301]
Well, so what? I'm not in the least bit interested in horse racing, are you?

[HEADER 00810302]
No, but it could be a clue to the killer's next move.

[HEADER 00810303]
Do you think his next victim will be the jockey, or the horse?

[HEADER 00810304]
She looked at me with a playful twinkle in her eye.

[HEADER 00810305]
Okay - it's a long shot.

[HEADER 00810306]
I don't think it is. That's too obvious.

[HEADER 00810307]
I wouldn't mind betting this is a coded message.

[HEADER 00810308]
It's a romantic notion, but I don't think so...

[HEADER 00810336]
Have you any idea what this tool is intended for?

[HEADER 00810337]
No, I haven't.

[HEADER 008102F4]
See you again, I hope.

[HEADER 008102F6]
Later, George.

[HEADER 00070005]
It was a soggy, crumpled paper tissue.

[HEADER 00070006]
I scooped up the sodden tissue. It was cold and greasy like breakfast leftovers.

[HEADER 00070004]
It was a small scrap of cloth, caught on the rusting spike.

[HEADER 00070003]
I took hold of the scrap of material and unsnagged it from the spike.

[HEADER 00920000]
Hi there!

[HEADER 00920001]
Hold it right there, you... you... sewer-rat!

[HEADER 00920002]
I knew you'd come back, and now I've got you!

[HEADER 00920003]
What are you talking about?

[HEADER 00920004]
You're trespassing! Come out of there immediately!

[HEADER 00920005]
That's what I'm trying to do...

[HEADER 00920006]
Give me your hand!

[HEADER 00920007]
You won't catch me with tricks like that!

[HEADER 00920008]
Keep your distance, m'sieur!

[HEADER 00920009]
Okay, okay!

[HEADER 0092000A]
Now, what were you looking for?

[HEADER 0092000B]
Terrorists.

[HEADER 0092000C]
The meanest, nastiest, dirtiest bunch of guys you ever saw!

[HEADER 0092000D]
Ah...! Englishmen, without a doubt. The filthy dogs!

[HEADER 0092000E]
The day they opened that tunnel was a bad day for France, I'll tell you.

[HEADER 0092000F]
If I still had the full use of my faculties, I'd march right over there and tell them so!

[HEADER 00920010]
Well, whoever they are, they blew up the café.

[HEADER 0092001A]
What!? The café? Blown up!?

[HEADER 0092001B]
Mon dieu! That's awful.

[HEADER 0092001C]
The guy who did it was a calculating, cold-blooded killer.

[HEADER 0092001D]
He was disguised as a clown.

[HEADER 0092001E]
I followed him into the sewer, and I think he came this way...

[HEADER 00920011]
I was looking for a clown.

[HEADER 00920012]
Ridiculous! Do you really expect me to believe that?

[HEADER 00920013]
He planted a bomb in the café and blew it up.

[HEADER 0092001F]
And you say the person responsible was dressed as a clown?

[HEADER 00920020]
That's right. He blew up the café, escaped into the sewer, changed his clothes, and came up here!

[HEADER 00920014]
A telephone. I need to make an urgent call.

[HEADER 00920015]
There is no telephone here.

[HEADER 00920016]
I want to know what you were doing in the sewer.

[HEADER 00920017]
Didn't you hear the explosion?

[HEADER 00920018]
In the sewer? A deadly cocktail of combustible gases and chemicals, most likely.

[HEADER 00920019]
No - at the café. A deadly cocktail of accordion music and villainy, most definitely.

[HEADER 00920021]
Did you say `accordion music'?

[HEADER 00920022]
Yeah. That fiend had no mercy.

[HEADER 00920023]
He was disguised as a clown.

[HEADER 00920024]
By the time the bomb went off he'd run to the sewer and made his escape.

[HEADER 00920025]
Mon dieu!

[HEADER 00920026]
Then the man I chased - do you think that man and the clown are...

[HEADER 00920027]
...one and the same?

[HEADER 00920028]
Well, yes - it had crossed my mind.

[HEADER 00920029]
That still doesn't explain what you were doing down the sewer...

[HEADER 0092002A]
For all I know you are in league with him!

[HEADER 0092002B]
Oh, no. I'm just a tourist.

[HEADER 0092002C]
Most tourists are content with the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or the Pigalle...

[HEADER 0092002D]
I didn't realize my waste pipes were such an attraction!

[HEADER 00920089]
Tell me about the man you apprehended...

[HEADER 0092008A]
Oh, he was a mean one, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0092008D]
He grabbed me in an arm lock, his face suddenly next to mine.

[HEADER 0092008E]
His grip was like iron, but he didn't know what he was up against...!

[HEADER 0092008F]
Oh, no. He made a big mistake when he took on one of the Desert Hyenas!

[HEADER 00920090]
Yes, yes. I get the picture.

[HEADER 00920091]
What is there to tell? He was a typical criminal type, just like you!

[HEADER 00920051]
Do you know the waitress at the café?

[HEADER 00920052]
You can't suspect her, surely?

[HEADER 00920053]
Just answer the question, please.

[HEADER 00920054]
Yes - I know her. Quite well, you could say.

[HEADER 00920055]
She came to work at the café, oh... six, seven months ago.

[HEADER 00920057]
I look forward all week to the relief she gives me when she visits.

[HEADER 00920058]
Really? So you'd miss her if she wasn't there?

[HEADER 00920059]
Mais oui! Who else would I find to cut my toenails?

[HEADER 0092005A]
She isn't hurt, is she?

[HEADER 0092005B]
No, she's fine.

[HEADER 0092005C]
Thank heavens!

[HEADER 0092005D]
A poor girl like her isn't safe with the likes of you roaming the streets!

[HEADER 0092005E]
Can't you understand? I'm not a gangster - I'm an American tourist!

[HEADER 0092005F]
Pah! That's what you say...

[HEADER 00920060]
Does the name Plantard mean anything to you?

[HEADER 00920061]
No, it doesn't.

[HEADER 00920064]
No, it doesn't. Who is he?

[HEADER 00920065]
The man who was killed in the café.

[HEADER 00920066]
I'm going to find the guy responsible.

[HEADER 00920067]
I'll find him. Even if it means following him down every sewer in every city in Europe!

[HEADER 00920068]
Bravo!

[HEADER 00920069]
You'll need some sensible boots.

[HEADER 0092006A]
You won't get far in those stupid sneakers.

[HEADER 00920049]
Was the guy you saw carrying a briefcase?

[HEADER 0092004A]
Why, yes - he was! Clutched in his arms like a baby.

[HEADER 0092004B]
That belonged to his victim.

[HEADER 0092004C]
What do you think was in it? Drugs? Stolen jewels?

[HEADER 0092004D]
I don't know, but the killer thought it was worth a man's life.

[HEADER 0092004E]
Nothing is worth that, m'sieur.

[HEADER 0092004F]
I didn't notice.

[HEADER 00920050]
Now, are you going to leave, or do I have to call the police?

[HEADER 0092006B]
Now - about the jacket you found... Do you have it here?

[HEADER 0092006C]
No, m'sieur. One of the sleeves was badly torn, so I sent it for repair.

[HEADER 0092006D]
A pity, because otherwise it was a fine piece of quality tailoring.

[HEADER 0092006E]
It had the tailor's name inside, on the label.

[HEADER 0092006F]
Where did you send the jacket?

[HEADER 00920070]
I gave it to an itinerant Romany seamstress.

[HEADER 00920071]
Just my luck.

[HEADER 00920072]
Was there anything in the jacket pockets?

[HEADER 00920073]
Not a sou!

[HEADER 00920074]
You know what I think?

[HEADER 00920077]
Do tell me...

[HEADER 00920078]
He changed out of the clown suit and cunningly disguised himself as an ordinary person!

[HEADER 00920079]
Looks like I'm up against a mastermind...

[HEADER 0092007A]
What was the name on the label?

[HEADER 0092007B]
It was a foreign name... Todryk, I think.

[HEADER 0092007C]
Did you get the address?

[HEADER 0092007D]
There wasn't one, m'sieur: only a telephone number.

[HEADER 0092007F]
Well, I don't expect you to remember a phone number you've only seen once!

[HEADER 00920080]
Seventy-four, ninety-eight, zero, eight, fifty-nine.

[HEADER 00920081]
You're kidding. That's his phone number?

[HEADER 00920082]
Yes, that's it. A little trick with numbers that I learned in the desert.

[HEADER 00920083]
I was taught the technique by a Tuareg shaman.

[HEADER 00920084]
That's incredible!

[HEADER 00920085]
It comes in handy at the supermarket check out...

[HEADER 00920086]
Do I get a reward?

[HEADER 00920087]
Honesty, m'sieur, is its own reward.

[HEADER 00920088]
Then I'm glad I don't rely on honesty to pay the bills!

[HEADER 009200C4]
Does this piece of material mean anything to you?

[HEADER 009200C5]
That is the same cloth as the jacket I found.

[HEADER 009200C6]
I'd recognize that pattern anywhere.

[HEADER 009200C9]
Do you recognize this material?

[HEADER 009200CA]
I'm not telling you anything!

[HEADER 00920097]
Take a look at this false nose...

[HEADER 00920098]
That looks like a clown's nose to me!

[HEADER 00920099]
Precisely. He must have dropped it in his panic.

[HEADER 0092009A]
Unless he wanted you to find it...

[HEADER 0092009B]
Why would he want to do that?

[HEADER 0092009C]
To put you off the scent!

[HEADER 0092009D]
I've never seen it before in my life.

[HEADER 009200EB]
What does this tissue mean to you?

[HEADER 009200EC]
Nothing, m'sieur. It's... disgusting.

[HEADER 009200ED]
What on earth possessed you to show it to me?

[HEADER 009200EE]
Some-one has emptied their nostrils into it!

[HEADER 009200D4]
Perhaps you'd like to take a look at my card...?

[HEADER 009200D5]
What's this...?

[HEADER 009200D6]
Inspecteur Augustin Rosso! What does that say - hominoid division?

[HEADER 009200D7]
Homicide. The ink has smudged.

[HEADER 009200D8]
Then you are not a tourist?

[HEADER 009200D9]
Okay - I'm not. I lied to you, and I'm sorry.

[HEADER 009200DA]
Don't apologise, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009200E1]
You know, I had a feeling there was something different about you.

[HEADER 009200E2]
It is your posture, your... poise!

[HEADER 009200E3]
Oh, yes - there's no mistaking the bearing of a disciplined man, and I should know.

[HEADER 009200E4]
I was in the army, you know.

[HEADER 009200E5]
When I was your age I was fighting for my life - in the African desert!

[HEADER 009200E6]
How can I help you, Inspecteur...?

[HEADER 009200A0]
What do you think of my ball?

[HEADER 009200A1]
Pah! I'm a little too old for games, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200A2]
Do you recognise the man in this photograph?

[HEADER 009200A3]
Yes, I do! It's that villain I told you about!

[HEADER 009200A4]
What does this powder mean to you?

[HEADER 009200A5]
Nothing, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200A6]
Does this gem mean anything to you?

[HEADER 009200A7]
Ah-ha! Is it real? It must be worth a small fortune!

[HEADER 009200A8]
A very large fortune, I'd say. Do you know anything about it?

[HEADER 009200A9]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200AA]
You stole it, I suppose?

[HEADER 009200AB]
I am not a crook!

[HEADER 009200AC]
Does the name Moerlin or Grüber Electronics mean anything to you?

[HEADER 009200AD]
Non, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200AF]
This is what I used to open the manhole cover...

[HEADER 009200B8]
Did I show you my tool?

[HEADER 009200B9]
Oui, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200BA]
Just like mine, except that it is much smaller...

[HEADER 009200B0]
I have one just the same as that, m'sieur. I will fetch it if you like!

[HEADER 009200B1]
No, don't bother.

[HEADER 009200B2]
Oh, it's no bother, m'sieur...

[HEADER 009200B3]
Nah - forget it.

[HEADER 009200B4]
Just trying to be helpful, m'sieur!

[HEADER 009200B6]
Just as I thought! You were up to no good down those sewers, weren't you?

[HEADER 009200B7]
One slip and I would have been up to my neck...

[HEADER 009200C1]
Do you recognize this matchbook?

[HEADER 009200C2]
I can't say I do, m'sieur.

[HEADER 009200CF]
Shake my hand. Go on - shake it.

[HEADER 009200D0]
You're joking, aren't you?

[HEADER 009200D1]
Nothing personal, but you've been mucking about down the sewer...

[HEADER 009200CD]
Does this medical apparatus mean anything to you?

[HEADER 009200CE]
Of course. It's a device for measuring blood pressure.

[HEADER 0092002E]
Hi there. Remember me?

[HEADER 0092002F]
Mais oui, Inspecteur. Have you found him?

[HEADER 00920030]
Who?

[HEADER 00920031]
The man in the sewer of course!

[HEADER 00920032]
I'm - uh... sifting through the evidence.

[HEADER 00920033]
Pouah! Rather you than me, m'sieur!

[HEADER 0092003D]
So, when you're not exploring sewers, what do you do?

[HEADER 0092003E]
I take a lot of showers.

[HEADER 0092003F]
Oh, very good, m'sieur. A policeman with a sense of humour!

[HEADER 00920092]
I have to be going...

[HEADER 00920093]
Thanks to your help, the citizens of Paris can sleep a little easier tonight.

[HEADER 00920094]
Vraiment? I was only doing my duty, m'sieur...

[HEADER 00920095]
Good luck, Inspecteur! I hope you catch that killer soon!

[HEADER 00001E20]
So the clown had escaped into the sewer...

[HEADER 00001E21]
...come up into the courtyard...

[HEADER 00001E22]
...and then slipped back into the street here.

[HEADER 00001E23]
It wasn't much.  But it was more than the cops had got.

[HEADER 00020009]
It was a battered old trash can...

[HEADER 0002000C]
I'd had it with sticking my nose into French trash cans...

[HEADER 0002000B]
It smelled like someone had dumped a truckload of fish in a locker room on a hot summer afternoon.

[HEADER 00020005]
The drainpipe hung limp and useless.

[HEADER 00020004]
The drainpipe looked as if it would bear my weight...

[HEADER 00020008]
I decided I'd had enough of messing with that drainpipe.

[HEADER 00020006]
I took a deep breath and prepared to climb the drainpipe...

[HEADER 00020007]
I guess the clown hadn't escaped over the rooftops.

[HEADER 00000A8C]
As I picked my self up, I was really angry. One minute I'm on vacation...

[HEADER 00000A8E]
... next minute some clown's blown me up. I knew right away what I was going to do.

[HEADER 00000A90]
I was going to find that clown - and bring him to justice.  Because Justice matters.

[HEADER 00000A92]
Justice is up there with Liberty.  And Equality.  And er... Fraternity.

[HEADER 00000A93]
After all, that was why I'd studied law, wasn't it?

[HEADER 00000AC8]
Well, that and the money of course...

[HEADER 00000A78]
I'd only been in Paris for a week...

[HEADER 00000A7A]
... but already I'd fallen in love with the city.

[HEADER 00000A7C]
My latest discovery was a little café - la Chandelle Verte.

[HEADER 00000A7E]
I was pretty sure the waitress...

[HEADER 00000A80]
... was taking a shine to me. That old Stobbart charm I guess.

[HEADER 00000A82]
Little did I know my reverie was about to be so rudely interrupted...

[HEADER 00040001]
It was a huge and weighty looking engineers' telephone.

[HEADER 005A00A5]
Hmm...

[HEADER 005A00A8]
Bonjour - Collard?

[HEADER 005A00A9]
Oh, hi. It's George Stobbart. The American at the café...

[HEADER 005A00AA]
I saw you, taking photographs.

[HEADER 005A00AB]
How did you get my number?

[HEADER 005A00AC]
The gendarme gave it me.

[HEADER 005A0003]
Hello, Nicole Collard.

[HEADER 005A0004]
Hello? It's George.

[HEADER 005A00B5]
Ah, oui!

[HEADER 005A00B6]
Uh... you said to call if I could help...

[HEADER 005A00B7]
Have you any news for me?

[HEADER 005A0005]
Oh, hi.

[HEADER 005A00BC]
You bet! I met a witness who spoke to the clown...

[HEADER 005A00BD]
...and I know where the killer gets his suits.

[HEADER 005A00BE]
No kidding? Hey, I'm impressed.

[HEADER 005A00BF]
You are? Well, it wasn't easy...

[HEADER 005A00C5]
I found the clown's escape route... I think.

[HEADER 005A00C6]
You think?

[HEADER 005A00C7]
He ran into a blind alley and took to the sewers.

[HEADER 005A00C8]
Very apt - but then what?

[HEADER 005A00C9]
I don't know. Maybe I could come see you?

[HEADER 005A00CA]
I really am very busy...

[HEADER 005A00CB]
Oh. Okay. I'll keep searching.

[HEADER 005A00CC]
Good. Be sure to let me know if you find anything.

[HEADER 005A00CD]
You can count on it.

[HEADER 005A00CE]
See you...

[HEADER 005A00CF]
Well, I haven't had a lot of luck...

[HEADER 005A00D0]
You've found nothing?

[HEADER 005A00D1]
Uh... no.

[HEADER 005A00D2]
Look - I'm very busy right now.

[HEADER 005A00D3]
Call me if you have any news, okay?

[HEADER 005A00D4]
Oh... yeah, I guess.

[HEADER 005A00D5]
Adieu, m'sieur.

[HEADER 005A00D6]
See you...

[HEADER 005A00D7]
Hello? Who is this?

[HEADER 005A00DC]
Hi! My name's George Stobbart. You don't know me.

[HEADER 005A00DD]
Correct, Mister Stobbart, I don't. What can I do for you?

[HEADER 005A00DE]
I'm trying to trace one of your customers.

[HEADER 005A00DF]
Could I maybe come over and talk to you?

[HEADER 005A00E0]
NO! No, that's not possible.

[HEADER 005A00E1]
Okay, forget it. Listen, all I want is a name.

[HEADER 005A00E2]
What are you talking about? Who are you working for?

[HEADER 005A00E3]
I guess you might say I'm acting in the interests of Truth and Justice.

[HEADER 005A00E4]
Ah, thank God! I thought you were the police...

[HEADER 005A00E5]
There are innocent lives at stake, mister Todryk - lives that you could save.

[HEADER 005A00E6]
You're collecting for charity, yes?

[HEADER 005A00E7]
No, I'm not. All I want from you is information.

[HEADER 005A00E8]
Go on, I'm listening...

[HEADER 005A00DA]
Mister Todryk?

[HEADER 005A00DB]
Oh, it's you again. What now?

[HEADER 005A00E9]
What do you know about the clown who bombed the Café de la Chandelle Verte?

[HEADER 005A00EA]
I don't have no idea what you're talking about.

[HEADER 005A00EB]
You're cool, Todryk, but I think you know more than you're saying.

[HEADER 005A00EC]
I don't know who you be, but sure I am you don't know what you're talking about!

[HEADER 005A00EE]
Oh, this is ridiculous. Quit playing games with me, Todryk.

[HEADER 005A00EF]
I tell you I know nothing about no clown.

[HEADER 005A00F0]
Did you know that one of your customers was a part-time clown?

[HEADER 005A00F1]
If a guy feels happy with a funny nose and custard down his pants, what's the problem?

[HEADER 005A00F2]
Do you know a guy called Plantard?

[HEADER 005A00F3]
No. I never heard of him.

[HEADER 005A00F4]
Shall I tell you what happened to Plantard?

[HEADER 005A00F5]
How he was killed in cold blood?

[HEADER 005A00F6]
I told you - I never heard of Plantard.

[HEADER 005A00F7]
I expect Plantard's a family man, don't you?

[HEADER 005A00F8]
In their little apartment, Madame Plantard is cooking the supper...

[HEADER 005A00F9]
Listening for the familiar sound of her husband's key in the door.

[HEADER 005A00FA]
Junior is waiting for his daddy to come home from work.

[HEADER 005A00FB]
He can't wait to show him the merit marks he earned in school today.

[HEADER 005A00FC]
Only tonight... Monsieur Plantard won't be coming home.

[HEADER 005A00FD]
You forgot the puppy.

[HEADER 005A00FE]
Huh?

[HEADER 005A00FF]
The faithful puppy dog, waiting for the sound of his master's voice...?

[HEADER 005A0100]
Maybe they don't have a dog. What do you think?

[HEADER 005A0101]
I don't know Plantard, I never heard of Plantard.

[HEADER 005A0102]
None of this has anything to do with me!

[HEADER 005A010A]
The man I'm looking for is called Khan.

[HEADER 005A010B]
He bought a suit from you - remember?

[HEADER 005A010C]
Mister Khan...

[HEADER 005A010D]
Yes - I remember him.

[HEADER 005A010E]
Yes. I delivered the suit to his hotel.

[HEADER 005A010F]
The Hôtel Ubu. I don't remember the room number.

[HEADER 005A0110]
It was upstairs - the second room on the right hand side of the corridor.

[HEADER 005A0111]
Thanks, Todryk. That's all I wanted to know.

[HEADER 005A0112]
Now I've got you, Mister Clown...

[HEADER 005A0103]
Did you make a suit for a man with a scar on his face?

[HEADER 005A0104]
A scar in the shape of a crescent moon?

[HEADER 005A0105]
Maybe... maybe not.

[HEADER 005A0106]
Tell me where I can find him and I'll leave you alone.

[HEADER 005A0107]
And if I don't?

[HEADER 005A0108]
I won't leave you alone.

[HEADER 005A0109]
I can't tell you anything unless you give me his name.

[HEADER 005A011F]
Thanks for nothing, Todryk.

[HEADER 00040008]
Set into the huge gate was a smaller access door.

[HEADER 00040009]
The door was securely locked.

[HEADER 0001000C]
The table had been overturned by the explosion.

[HEADER 0001000D]
I considered straightening the table, but I figured it best not to disturb the evidence.

[HEADER 00010012]
The blast had blown out the glass leaving a gaping hole.

[HEADER 00010013]
I examined the jagged glass remaining in the window. It was broken all right.

[HEADER 00001E1F]
The clown had fled into this alley - but there was no sign of him now.

[HEADER 00001E24]
I was intrigued by Nico and what she could tell me about the explosion.

[HEADER 00020002]
It was a plastic crate.

[HEADER 00020003]
There was nothing of interest...

[HEADER 00001D9B]
The police had removed the body, but nothing else looked disturbed.

[HEADER 00001D56]
I am afraid that you can't go in there, Madame.

[HEADER 00001D57]
Okay, okay...

[HEADER 00001D4C]
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

[HEADER 00001D4D]
I wanted to see the crime scene for myself.

[HEADER 00001D4E]
It's too dangerous.  I am under strict instructions to stop gossip mongers and vandals from getting in.

[HEADER 00001D4F]
But I'm a journalist.

[HEADER 00001D50]
Exactly. Didn't you hear what I just said?

[HEADER 00001D51]
What if I told you I was from the insurance company?

[HEADER 00001D52]
I'd ask for your ID.

[HEADER 00001D53]
Ah...

[HEADER 00001D54]
I told you to keep out of there!

[HEADER 00001D55]
Okay, okay...

[HEADER 00001D84]
One thing I'd learned as a journalist - find the weak spot.

[HEADER 00001D85]
There was more than a hint of hair-spray about this guy.

[HEADER 00001D86]
And for a workman he was pretty well-turned out.

[HEADER 00001D87]
A vain man is easy to distract.  So they say.

[HEADER 00001D60]
The workman looked about as eager and helpful as your average road-digger.

[HEADER 00001D61]
Hello, could I ask you some questions?

[HEADER 00001D62]
That depends.  Are you a cop?

[HEADER 00001D63]
No, I'm a journalist.

[HEADER 00001D64]
Bit late aren't you? They already took away the body.

[HEADER 00001D65]
I'm doing a follow-up on the story.

[HEADER 00001D66]
Hello.

[HEADER 00001D67]
Yes?

[HEADER 00001D68]
Have the police finished with the crime scene?

[HEADER 00001D69]
What does it look like?  I got orders to board up the windows, and that's what I'm doing.

[HEADER 00001D6A]
So the body's been removed?

[HEADER 00001D6B]
I certainly hope so or it'll stink to high heaven when they take down these boards.

[HEADER 00001D6C]
Shouldn't you check?

[HEADER 00001D6D]
Are you kidding? They don't pay me enough to put up boards, let alone check for dead bodies.

[HEADER 00001D6E]
Tell me, are you related to the workman I saw digging the hole?

[HEADER 00001D6F]
Don't talk to me about Flobbage.  Pah!

[HEADER 00001D70]
Okay...

[HEADER 00001D71]
He just won a fortune on the horses and he won't give me a cent.

[HEADER 00001D72]
Well, it's his money...

[HEADER 00001D73]
When he was broke, he was happy to touch me for a loan.

[HEADER 00001D74]
"Brothers should look after each other!" he used to say.

[HEADER 00001D75]
He's changed his tune now he's brassed up.

[HEADER 00001D76]
You're doing a fine job!

[HEADER 00001D77]
Damn right I am. You should be writing about me, not that idiot that got blown up.

[HEADER 00001D78]
The heroes who pick up the pieces when disaster strikes...

[HEADER 00001D79]
Exactly.

[HEADER 00001D7A]
Well, give me your best smile and maybe I'll put your picture in the article.

[HEADER 00001D7B]
Oh! Right! Just give me a minute to do my hair...

[HEADER 00001D7C]
I need to take some more pictures.

[HEADER 00001D7D]
Of course. My pleasure.

[HEADER 00000D14]
Give me a moment.

[HEADER 00001DE2]
Look at this secret message.

[HEADER 00001DE3]
Very nice.  But it's not secret now, is it?  It's just a message.

[HEADER 00001D88]
Have you ever seen anything like this?

[HEADER 00001D89]
What do you think I am - a plumber?!

[HEADER 00001D8A]
What do you think of my shell case?

[HEADER 00001D8B]
Are you in the scrap business?

[HEADER 00001D8C]
Of course not.

[HEADER 00001D8D]
Pity.  I've got some rubbish just like that I need to get rid of.

[HEADER 00001D8E]
Take a look at this...

[HEADER 00001D8F]
I don't like lacy hankies.  They scratch my nose.

[HEADER 00001D90]
I can see how that must be a problem for you.

[HEADER 00001D91]
Do you know how I could get the paint out of this cloth?

[HEADER 00001D92]
What do you think this is - household tips week?

[HEADER 00001D93]
Do you know this man?

[HEADER 00001D94]
He looks like a nasty piece of work.

[HEADER 00001D95]
I had an uncle who was with the fascists.  But we never talk about him.

[HEADER 00001D96]
What happened to him?

[HEADER 00001D97]
How should I know?!  We never talk about him.

[HEADER 00001D98]
Would you like this hairclip?

[HEADER 00001D99]
What do you take me for? Some kind of a...

[HEADER 00001D9A]
...pervert?

[HEADER 00001DF1]
What do you think of this pouch?

[HEADER 00001DF2]
Very nice.  Takes me back to my posing days.

[HEADER 00001DF3]
Posing?

[HEADER 00001DF4]
Art school.  With a body like mine - I was never out of work.   I can show you if you like.

[HEADER 00001DF5]
I'd rather not. I've only just eaten.

[HEADER 00001DE4]
Do you recognise this?

[HEADER 00001DE5]
It looks like a kids' puzzle piece.

[HEADER 00000D7A]
Would you like to see this...?

[HEADER 00000D79]
No.

[HEADER 00001DE6]
You see this ticket.

[HEADER 00001DE7]
Are you trying to bribe me?

[HEADER 00001DE8]
No.

[HEADER 00001DE9]
I don't blame you of course.  Good looking fella like me.

[HEADER 00001DEA]
Do you like this colour?

[HEADER 00001DEB]
It's all right.  But with skin tones like mine, I tend to go for softer, more sophisticated shades.

[HEADER 00001DEC]
Would you recognise this?

[HEADER 00001DED]
That is the key to a safe.  A Warriner special if I'm not mistaken.

[HEADER 00001DEE]
Do you like this carving?

[HEADER 00001DEF]
Hmph.  It's the kind of thing you pick up for a couple of euros at Les Puces de Saint-Ouen.

[HEADER 00001DF0]
He wouldn't be interested in a substitution cipher.

[HEADER 00000D7B]
He wouldn't be interested...

[HEADER 00001D7E]
Au revoir.

[HEADER 00001CFC]
Hey!  What about my photos?

[HEADER 00001CFD]
Oh!  Of course!  How could I forget?

[HEADER 00001CFE]
Well.  I'm waiting.  Get your camera out.

[HEADER 00001CFF]
Camera? Oh, I forgot!  It broke!

[HEADER 00001D00]
Alors!  They should never send a woman to do a man's job!

[HEADER 00001D01]
Well, this woman had fooled him easily enough...

[HEADER 00001D02]
...and found evidence the police had missed!

[HEADER 00001D7F]
Hey - what were you doing in there?!

[HEADER 00001D80]
Oh, just checking the light for your photo.

[HEADER 00001D81]
Loading the camera.

[HEADER 00001D82]
Nothing really.

[HEADER 00001D83]
Ah, of course.

[HEADER 00001D9E]
One piece of glass survived - the rest had been smashed to pieces.

[HEADER 00001DA1]
Oops!  Stupid thing...

[HEADER 00001D9C]
It was a Brandy bottle.

[HEADER 00001D9D]
Some journalists drink on the job. Not me.

[HEADER 00001DA8]
Behind the table were some damaged pipes...

[HEADER 00001DA4]
Voilà! The police and forensics teams had missed a vital piece of evidence: some kind of pouch.

[HEADER 00001DA5]
On the pouch was the cross symbol of Carchon's organisation. I was on the right track.

[HEADER 00001DA3]
I couldn't quite reach far enough to get hold of anything.

[HEADER 00001D06]
The strange metal artefact I found in Plantard's pouch...

[HEADER 00001D07]
...had pointed back to the quayside.

[HEADER 00001D0B]
I wondered what was in Plantard's pouch.

[HEADER 00001D0C]
I needed to take a closer look at the objects I'd found in Plantard's pouch.

[HEADER 00001D08]
I needed some direction.

[HEADER 00001D09]
Some clue to where I should go next...

[HEADER 00001DB0]
The drainpipe had been pulled from the wall. Some idiot had clearly tried to climb it.

[HEADER 00001DB1]
The drainpipe was well past its replacement date.

[HEADER 00001DB2]
The pipes weren't going to help my investigation.

[HEADER 00001DB3]
From the stench, the hole obviously led down to the sewers.

[HEADER 00001DB4]
There might have been clues down there.

[HEADER 00001DB5]
But I was relieved I didn't have a sewer key.

[HEADER 00001D0A]
I couldn't do anything with that...

[HEADER 00001D9F]
A panel had been blown away, revealing a gap.

[HEADER 00001DA0]
From this angle, I could see that something had been lodged in the gap behind the pipes.

[HEADER 00001DA6]
Plantard's blood was everywhere. Poor guy, never stood a chance.

[HEADER 00001DA7]
There was nothing of interest beyond some bloody debris.

[HEADER 00001DA9]
Now I'd seen it in the mirror I could make out something behind the pipes.

[HEADER 00001DB6]
There was a little workman's tent.

[HEADER 00001DB7]
There was a toolbox inside the tent.

[HEADER 00001DB8]
The tent was empty except for a toolbox.

[HEADER 00001DB9]
As my dear grandmamma used to say - keep your hands off men's tools.

[HEADER 00001DBA]
It was the kind of ancient phone beloved of French workmen.

[HEADER 00001DBB]
I was surprised they still used them.

[HEADER 00001DBC]
I didn't need to call anyone.

[HEADER 00001DBD]
There was a small door set into the entrance gates.

[HEADER 00001DBE]
But nothing to say who lived there.

[HEADER 00001DBF]
The door was locked.

[HEADER 00001E14]
Apart from a bit in the middle, the mirror had smashed into a thousand pieces. Bad luck for someone.

[HEADER 00001E15]
The mirror had smashed into a thousand pieces. Bad luck for some.

[HEADER 00001E16]
Poor guy.

[HEADER 00001E17]
I hoped the fact that the mirror was already broken meant I'd escape the bad luck.

[HEADER 00001E19]
He was pretty mashed up.

[HEADER 00001DC4]
The police had been quick to clear away the wreckage, and arrange for the window to be boarded up.

[HEADER 00001DC5]
There was nothing I could do.  The workman had everything under control.

[HEADER 00001E1A]
The big story was about the brutal murder of a French media magnate, shot down in cold blood.

[HEADER 00001E1B]
The guy oozed confidence - like a regular French statesman.

[HEADER 00001E1C]
The column was devoted exclusively to rumour, gossip and sensationalism.

[HEADER 00001E1D]
I noticed the writing at the foot of the page...

[HEADER 00001E1E]
It read: `Salah-eh Dinn, thirteen forty-five.'
